# The Divine Attributes of God

This document outlines your current positions on the nature and attributes of God, shaped by historical theology and informed by your desire for intellectual rigor and apologetic strength.

## God's Relationship to Time

You adopt **John Polkinghorne’s Block Universe (Eternalism) view**:

- All moments of time—past, present, future—are equally real.
- God is not “timeless” nor strictly “within time,” but exists in **meta-time**, observing all events from a vantage point outside chronological sequence.
- God's **omniscience** is understood as seeing the whole of time at once.
- This view accommodates both divine sovereignty and creaturely freedom, and aligns with **middle knowledge** (see `middle-knowledge.md`).

You plan to **further explore**:
- A-theory vs B-theory of time
- Boethian timelessness
- Formal analysis of the Block Universe theory

## Omniscience

- You affirm **comprehensive omniscience**: God knows all things actual and possible.
- You incorporate **Middle Knowledge** (see `middle-knowledge.md`), grounding God’s knowledge of all counterfactuals without causal determination.
- God's omniscience is consistent with His engagement with temporal creatures through meta-time.

---

## Omnipresence

You affirm the **Punctiliar Presence View**:
- God is fully present at every point in time and space—**not merely diffused** throughout the universe, nor present only in a **metaphysical sense**.
- His presence is **actual and personal**, and He is present at **every location**, though not always **manifest**.

This view arose in **modern theology** and emphasizes **relational immediacy** over abstract substance metaphysics. You considered objections (e.g., divine localization or spatial limits) and found them answerable within your meta-time model.

## Omnipotence

You affirm the **contemporary compatibilist view**:
- God can do all things **that are logically possible** and consistent with His nature.
- You accept that **God voluntarily limits His power** to allow free will and meaningful relationship.

You also affirm:
- **Interventionist capacity**: God can act within creation in miraculous ways.
- **Intellectualism**: God's will is guided by His wisdom and reason, not arbitrary choice.

## Omnibenevolence

You adopt a **contemporary middle-ground definition of goodness**:
- God is the **standard of goodness**, but “good” is not arbitrary—it involves **moral coherence**, **relational faithfulness**, and **truthfulness**.
- You reject voluntarism and strict moral realism as extremes.

You also affirm:
- God's love is **personal**, **dynamic**, and **responsive** within the framework of meta-time.
- You prefer the **Exclusivist view** (currently) that God's salvific love is definitively expressed through Christ alone (subject to reevaluation after full exploration of salvation and human freedom).

---

## Current Open Topics
- Formal analysis of **God’s simplicity, immutability, and impassibility**
- Your view on **aseity** is assumed but not yet explored.
- You plan to discuss the “substance” of the Trinity (noted for future exploration).
