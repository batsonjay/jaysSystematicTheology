# Existence of God

This document explores the rational case for the existence of God as the opening locus of this systematic theology. It focuses especially on the **Kalam Cosmological Argument** as currently adopted, while leaving room for further work in natural theology (fine-tuning, moral, contingency, ontological arguments, etc.). The aim is to provide a conceptual and rational foundation that supports later loci on divine nature and attributes, salvation, and the problem of evil.

## I. Background and Biblical Foundations

- This locus asks whether and how we can **know that God exists** using **reason and evidence**, prior to or alongside explicit appeal to special revelation.
- Biblically, Scripture often **assumes** God’s existence rather than arguing for it in a modern philosophical sense (e.g., Genesis 1:1, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth").
- At the same time, Scripture affirms that creation itself bears **witness** to God:
  - Psalm 19:1–4: *"The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands."*
  - Romans 1:19–20: God’s invisible attributes are *"clearly perceived"* in the things that have been made.
- Historically, Christian theology has developed a range of **natural theological arguments**—philosophical reflections on the world that point beyond it to a transcendent creator.
- In this project, the goal is not to provide an exhaustive natural theology but to:
  - Clarify which arguments for God’s existence are most compelling to me.
  - Integrate them coherently with a broader doctrine of God (especially views on **time**, **causation**, and **divine attributes**).

## II. Survey of Major Arguments and Approaches

This section sketches the main families of arguments and approaches to God’s existence that are or may become live options in this project. At present, only the **Kalam Cosmological Argument** is fully adopted; the others are noted for future exploration.

### 1. Kalam Cosmological Argument (Adopted)

**Core Syllogism** (following William Lane Craig):

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
2. The universe began to exist.
3. Therefore, the universe has a cause.

**Intended Theological Conclusion:**
- The cause of the universe is **spaceless**, **timeless (sans creation)**, **immaterial**, **personal**, and **immensely powerful**—fitting well with the Christian doctrine of God.

**Motivations and Context:**
- Rehabilitates a **cosmological argument** in light of both **philosophical** considerations (about causation, infinities, and beginnings) and **modern cosmology** (Big Bang, thermodynamics).
- Aims to show that the **existence of the universe** itself calls for a transcendent cause rather than being a brute fact.

### 2. Fine-Tuning Argument (Deferred)

**Basic Idea (to be developed):**
- The fundamental constants and initial conditions of the universe appear to be **finely tuned** for life-enabling conditions.
- This is taken by some to favor a **designing intelligence** over chance or multiverse explanations.

Status in this project:
- **Deferred / in progress.** I have not yet worked through the technical and philosophical literature enough to adopt a specific formulation.

### 3. Moral Argument (Deferred)

**Basic Idea (to be developed):**
- If **objective moral values and duties** exist, they are best explained by a **personal, perfectly good God**.

Status in this project:
- **Deferred / in progress.** I anticipate strong connections with the doctrines of **divine nature and attributes** and **anthropology**.

### 4. Contingency / Cosmological Arguments (Non-Kalam) (Deferred)

**Basic Idea (to be developed):**
- Contingent beings (or the contingent universe as a whole) require an explanation in a **necessary being** (e.g., Leibnizian contingency arguments).

Status in this project:
- **Deferred / in progress.** Needs more careful work, especially on the nature of necessity, explanation, and the principle of sufficient reason.

### 5. Ontological Arguments (Deferred)

**Basic Idea (to be developed):**
- Arguments from the **concept of God** (e.g., Anselm, Plantinga’s modal ontological argument) aiming to show that if God’s existence is possible, God exists necessarily.

Status in this project:
- **Deferred / in progress.** I plan to examine classic and contemporary versions, but have not yet adopted any as part of the core case.

### 6. Broader Natural Theology and Existential/Experiential Arguments (Deferred)

**Basic Idea (to be developed):**
- A wider range of considerations—religious experience, the intelligibility of the universe, the fit between mind and world, etc.—may also support belief in God.

Status in this project:
- **Deferred / in progress.** This area will likely grow as other loci (e.g., revelation, Christology, anthropology) are developed.

## III. Comparative Summary (Provisional)

At a high level, the main argument families can be sketched as follows (to be expanded as study continues):

| Argument Family        | Focus of Argument                         | Key Intuition                                             | Current Status in This Project  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Kalam Cosmological** | Beginning of the universe                 | Whatever begins to exist has a cause; the universe began  | **Adopted**                     |
| Fine-Tuning            | Physical constants / initial conditions   | Life-permitting universe is improbable on chance alone    | Deferred                        |
| Moral                  | Objective moral values and duties         | Moral realism fits best with a personal, good God         | Deferred                        |
| Contingency            | Contingent existence of the universe      | Contingency calls for a necessary, self-explanatory being | Deferred                        |
| Ontological            | Concept of a maximally great being        | If God’s existence is possible, God exists necessarily    | Deferred                        |
| Experiential / Other   | Experience, intelligibility, etc.         | Lived reality points beyond itself to transcendence       | Deferred                        |

This table is intended as a **roadmap** rather than a settled map; only the Kalam argument is currently integrated as an adopted component of the system.

## IV. Evaluation and Arguments (Provisional)

### 1. Why the Kalam Cosmological Argument Is Persuasive

The Kalam Cosmological Argument is, at present, the **central adopted argument** for God’s existence in this project.

**a. Philosophical Structure**

- The basic syllogism is **logically valid**; if both premises are true, the conclusion follows.
- Premise 1 (*whatever begins to exist has a cause*) expresses a deeply intuitive and widely held **causal principle**. Denying it seems to undermine rational inquiry itself.
- Premise 2 (*the universe began to exist*) focuses the debate on whether an **infinite regress of past events** is possible and on what modern cosmology implies.

**b. Actual Infinities and the Beginning of the Universe**

- Classical Kalam-style arguments (as in William Lane Craig) contend that an **actual infinite** (e.g., an infinite sequence of completed past events) is metaphysically impossible.
- Illustrations such as **Hilbert’s Hotel** aim to show that actual infinities generate paradoxes when treated as completed totalities, suggesting that the past cannot consist of an actually infinite number of events.
- Even apart from strict impossibility claims, the idea of a **beginningless temporal series** of events is philosophically problematic: how could one "traverse" an actually infinite sequence to arrive at the present?

**c. Support from Modern Cosmology**

- Contemporary cosmology (e.g., **Big Bang** models, **thermodynamics** and entropy considerations, certain singularity theorems) is often interpreted as pointing to a **finite past** and a universe that **began to exist**.
- While cosmology is complex and evolving, current mainstream models sit comfortably with, and in some cases positively suggest, a beginning of the observable universe.

**d. From a First Cause to God**

- The conclusion that the universe has a **cause** invites further analysis of what such a cause would be like:
  - **Spaceless and immaterial:** because space-time itself is part of the universe that began, and God must be spaceless in order to exist.
  - **Timeless sans creation:** in some sense, because time as we know it is tied to the universe’s history.
  - **Enormously powerful:** to bring the entire universe into existence.
  - **Personal:** to explain how a timeless cause can produce a temporal effect (choosing to create rather than acting by impersonal necessity).
- These features cohere well with classical Christian theism and provide a significant piece of rational support for belief in God.

### 2. Integration with Views on Time (Block Universe and Meta-Time)

The Kalam argument is often formulated with a relatively **linear view of time**. In this project, however, my broader doctrine of God includes a **block universe** perspective, influenced in part by **John Polkinghorne** and by my own reflections on God and time.

- I affirm a kind of **block universe** model in which all of created history is, in some sense, given as a whole—a four-dimensional space-time manifold.
- To integrate this with the Kalam argument, I posit that God exists in **meta-time**:
  - **Before** creation (in meta-time), God exists without the created space-time block.
  - **At** creation, God brings the entire space-time block into existence; this is the "beginning" of the universe in both cosmological and metaphysical senses.
  - God can be related to the whole of created time while still being in a distinct **meta-temporal** relation to it.
- This differs slightly from William Lane Craig’s view, in which God is often said to be **timeless sans creation** and then **temporal from the moment of creation onward**. My view emphasizes a more explicit **meta-time** dimension in which God’s life includes, but is not reducible to, the created temporal order.

For a fuller treatment of these issues, see [God and Time](./God-and-time.md) and [Divine Nature and Attributes](./divine-nature-and-attributes.md).

### 3. Provisional Assessment of Other Arguments

- **Fine-Tuning:** Intuitively powerful and pastorally useful, but I have not yet carefully weighed the details of cosmology, multiverse hypotheses, and design inferences.
- **Moral Argument:** Attractive given my conviction that **objective moral values and duties** are real, but I still need to articulate how this interacts with my doctrine of **divine goodness** and **human nature**.
- **Contingency Arguments:** Potentially very powerful, but I need a more settled view on the **principle of sufficient reason**, the nature of **necessary beings**, and the status of "brute facts".
- **Ontological Arguments:** Fascinating and elegant, especially in Plantinga’s modal form, but I am not yet prepared to adopt them as part of the core case without further work on modality and possibility.

These arguments remain **live options** for future adoption or integration but are not currently part of the adopted core.

## V. Adopted Position(s)

**Working Definition (subject to refinement):**

> I affirm that God exists and that this belief is rationally supported, in part, by the Kalam Cosmological Argument: whatever begins to exist has a cause; the universe began to exist; therefore, the universe has a cause. The best explanation of this cause is a personal, immaterial, spaceless, and supremely powerful creator whose life stands in a meta-temporal relation to the created space-time block.

Key features of the adopted position at this locus:

- **Existence of God:** Affirmed as the foundational commitment of this theology.
- **Kalam as Central Argument:** Among classical and contemporary arguments, the **Kalam Cosmological Argument** currently functions as the **most developed and adopted** piece of natural theology in this project.
- **Meta-Time and Block Universe:** God is understood as existing in **meta-time** relative to the created space-time block, integrating the Kalam argument’s focus on a beginning with a block universe model of time.
- **Openness to Additional Arguments:** I anticipate that other arguments (fine-tuning, moral, contingency, ontological) may eventually be reflected here after further examination, but at present they are treated as **deferred** pending further study.

---

## VI. Implications and Pastoral Considerations (Optional but Encouraged)

- **For Personal Faith:** The Kalam argument offers a way of seeing the universe itself as a kind of **signpost** to God. The fact that there is a universe with a beginning is not a trivial brute fact but points to a transcendent cause.
- **For Defense of the Faith:** In conversations with sincere skeptics or seekers, the Kalam argument can provide a **clear, accessible entry point** into natural theology. It does not presume Christian scripture but is compatible with, and supportive of, Christian theism.
- **For Struggling Believers:** For those wrestling with doubt, it can be encouraging to know that there are **serious philosophical and scientific arguments** that make belief in God intellectually respectable and even compelling.
- **For Integration with Other Loci:**
  - This locus supports and is supported by the doctrine of **divine attributes** (e.g., God’s power, eternity, immateriality).
  - It interacts deeply with the **problem of evil** (if there is a powerful, good creator, how do we account for suffering and evil?).
  - It lays groundwork for understanding **revelation** and **salvation** as actions of a God whose existence is not merely assumed but also argued for.

## VII. Objections and Responses (In Progress)

This section will collect major objections to the Kalam Cosmological Argument (and to the broader claim that God’s existence can be supported by natural theology) along with provisional responses.

- **Objection 1: Premise 1 is not universally valid.**  Some argue that at the quantum level, events may occur without causes, or that the universe as a whole is an exception to ordinary causal principles.
  - **Provisional Response:** Even if some physical processes are indeterministic, this does not show that they are uncaused in a robust metaphysical sense. Moreover, the principle in Premise 1 is not a claim about every microphysical event but about the general metaphysical intuition that **things that begin to exist do not pop into being from nothing without any cause whatsoever**.

- **Objection 2: The universe may not have a beginning.** Competing cosmological models (e.g., eternal inflation, cyclic or bouncing models) may preserve an eternal or beginningless universe.
  - **Provisional Response:** The philosophical concerns about an **actual infinite past** remain, and some singularity theorems and entropy considerations still pose challenges for past-eternal models. Nonetheless, this is an area where I remain open to ongoing scientific and philosophical debate, and in the meantime can hold my position in the same way a scientist holds the "current most well-supported theory".

- **Objection 3: The cause of the universe need not be God.** Even granting that the universe has a cause, critics may argue that it could be some impersonal initial state, a law, or a brute unexplained fact, rather than a personal theistic God.
  - **Provisional Response:** The inference to a **personal, powerful, immaterial cause** is not a mere label but flows from analyzing what it would take to bring a universe into existence from nothing. While more work is needed here, I find the case for a **personal creator** stronger than for impersonal alternatives.

**Status:** This section is **in progress** and will expand as I engage more fully with critical literature on Kalam and natural theology.

## VIII. Open Questions and Deferred Issues

- **Status of Other Arguments:** To what extent should the fine-tuning, moral, contingency, and ontological arguments become part of the **adopted** case for God’s existence in this project? What exact formulations are most persuasive?
- **Metaphysics of Time:** How precisely should I articulate the relationship between God’s **meta-time** and the created **space-time block**? How does this connect with other doctrines (e.g., providence, predestination)? See [God and Time](./God-and-time.md).
- **Natural Theology’s Role:** How central should natural-theological arguments be within a Christian theology that also emphasizes **revelation in Christ and Scripture**? What is the right balance between rational arguments and lived, ecclesial, and spiritual grounds for belief?
- **Epistemic Status of Belief in God:** Even if these arguments are sound, what is the best account of how people actually come to know God (e.g., **Reformed epistemology**, sensus divinitatis, experience of the Holy Spirit)?

For now, the **Kalam Cosmological Argument**—integrated with a block universe and meta-time view of God—serves as the adopted rational foundation for the existence of God in this project, held with humility and openness to revision as study continues.
