# Theological Anthropology

## Overview

Theological anthropology addresses the nature, origin, purpose, and destiny of human beings from a theological perspective. It seeks to answer questions such as:

- What does it mean to be made in the image of God?
- What distinguishes humanity from the rest of creation?
- What is the nature of human freedom, sin, and moral responsibility?
- What was God’s intention in creating humanity?

## Your Current Commitments

You have made the following preliminary affirmations:

- You hold to **evolutionary creationism**, accepting that God used evolutionary processes to bring about human life.
- You interpret the **Genesis creation narrative** as a theological expression of Israel’s identity and purpose, not a literal scientific account.
- You affirm that **humans are created for relationship with God**, and that this relationship marks a theological “beginning” of humanity.
- You anticipate the need to define a **theological threshold** in evolutionary history at which "humanity" (as a moral and spiritual category) begins.

## Topics Identified for Future Development

You intend to return to several questions as your system develops further:

- 🔖 Define more precisely what constitutes the creation of "humanity" theologically, within an evolutionary framework.
- 🔖 Determine the compatibility of original sin with evolutionary ancestry.
- 🔖 Investigate models of the image of God (*imago Dei*), including:
  - **Substantive** (reason/soul)
  - **Relational** (capacity for relationship with God/others)
  - **Functional** (dominion or stewardship)
- 🔖 Explore models of freedom:
  - Libertarian freedom (necessary for moral responsibility?)
  - Compatibilist freedom (consistent with Molinism?)

## Integration with Other Doctrines

- Your Molinist commitment affirms meaningful human freedom.
- You see the image of God as part of the reason humans are morally accountable.
- The problem of evil and the need for salvation will be directly shaped by your anthropology.

> You have deferred formal commitment on many of these until further exploration.
