# Christology

## Overview

Christology explores the identity, nature, and mission of Jesus Christ. Your view integrates biblical testimony, philosophical theology, and insights from church history, while being shaped by your positions on time, divine knowledge, and salvation.

## Your Current Commitments

You affirm the following:

- Jesus is fully divine and fully human, in a unique and unrepeatable unity.
- You adopt William Lane Craig’s view of Christology *with modifications*:
  - Christ has a divine mind (the Logos) and a human mind (a “discernment-consciousness”).
  - These are united in a single person—without division of being—but with functional asymmetry.
- You do **not** use the term “person” to describe the members of the Trinity, instead preferring language of **meta-temporal modes of relational self-presence**.
- Jesus, as the incarnate Logos, is the **meta-temporal** expression of God entering into time and creation.

## Integration with the Trinity

- Your trinitarian model affirms **one divine essence** eternally existing as three distinguishable yet indivisible **modes of presence**, each capable of distinct action in salvation history.
- The incarnate Christ is the **temporal mode** who enters created time, while remaining metaphysically grounded in the divine essence.

## Relationship to Time and Knowledge

- God exists **beyond time** in a *Block Universe* model (as you adopt from Polkinghorne), yet **engages with time** through the incarnate Christ.
- Christ’s human consciousness operates within linear time.
- Divine omniscience operates via **middle knowledge**, such that Christ, as the Logos, had access to all logically possible and feasible truths but experienced limitation in his incarnate form.

## Commitments on Related Doctrines

- You affirm the **Virgin Birth**, **bodily resurrection**, and **ascension** of Jesus Christ as real historical events.
- You defer full discussion of the atonement, but affirm that Christ’s life, death, and resurrection accomplish reconciliation between God and humanity.
