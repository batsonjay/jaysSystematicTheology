AI discussion: Predestination is a complex and often contentious topic within systematic theology. It touches on God’s sovereignty, human free will, God’s foreknowledge, and the nature of salvation. Here are the major viewpoints on predestination:
	1.	Calvinism (Double Predestination):
	•	Calvinism argues for “double predestination,” where God has elected some individuals to salvation (the elect) and others to damnation (the reprobate). This is often based on God’s sovereign will and purpose, not on any foreseen response or merit on the part of individuals.
	2.	Arminianism (Conditional Election):
	•	Arminian theology teaches “conditional election,” where predestination is based on God’s foreknowledge of who will believe in Christ and persevere in faith. In this view, God’s predestining decision is a response to human action.
	3.	Molinism (Middle Knowledge):
	•	Molinism asserts that God possesses “middle knowledge,” through which He knows what any free creature would do under any possible set of circumstances. Thus, God can sovereignly orchestrate events knowing how individuals will freely choose to respond.
	4.	Open Theism (Open Future):
	•	Open Theism posits that God has not predetermined the future, but rather has left it open. This view suggests that God has given human beings genuine free will and the future is not exhaustively settled.
	5.	Universal Reconciliation (Universalism):
	•	This view suggests that in the end, all will be reconciled to God through Christ. It posits a hopeful or assured universal salvation, where God’s predestining work is to redeem all creation.
	6.	Single Predestination:
	•	A more moderate Calvinist view, where God predestines some to salvation but does not actively predestine the rest to damnation; they are simply left in their sin.

Each of these views attempts to balance scriptural passages that speak to God’s sovereign choice and human responsibility. They also reflect different understandings of God’s nature and His interaction with time and human beings.

Given your system’s current alignment, particularly the adoption of Exclusivism and a nuanced understanding of God’s relationship with time (block theory adaptation), Molinism or Arminianism could be compatible, as both allow for significant human freedom and decision in response to God’s sovereign will, and both could be integrated into a block universe perspective where God knows all choices without determining them.

Would you like to explore one of these views further, or would you prefer to choose a different one to potentially include in your systematic theology?

Prompt: I agree those two fit what we have developed so far. Can you contrast those two a bit more, please?

AI reply: Certainly. Here’s a more detailed contrast between Molinism and Arminianism, focusing on how they view the interplay between divine foreknowledge, predestination, and human free will:

Molinism:
	•	Founded by Luis de Molina, Molinism posits that God has “middle knowledge” (scientia media), which includes knowledge of all possible decisions that free creatures (like humans) could make in any given circumstance.
	•	God’s predestinative decree is then made with this middle knowledge in mind, ensuring that human free will is maintained while also accomplishing divine purposes.
	•	God’s election of individuals is based on His foreknowledge of their free choices under certain circumstances, which He can bring about without overriding free will.
	•	This view allows for a robust conception of God’s sovereignty and control over all that happens, while still affirming that humans are free and responsible for their choices.

Arminianism:
	•	Named after Jacobus Arminius, Arminianism emphasizes conditional election, where God’s predestination of individuals to salvation is based on His foreknowledge of who will have faith in Christ.
	•	In this view, God’s foreknowledge is simple and does not include middle knowledge of all possible worlds or choices. Rather, God knows what will actually happen in the future, including who will respond to His grace.
	•	Human free will is significant in that it allows individuals to accept or reject God’s offer of salvation. God’s grace is necessary for salvation, but it is resistible.
	•	While God is sovereign and can foresee the future, He does not determine every aspect of it. Human beings play an active role in how the future unfolds.

Both views agree that God knows the future and that humans are able to make meaningful choices. The primary difference lies in how they understand God’s knowledge and its relation to human freedom:
	•	Molinism suggests a more intricate and proactive role of God in planning the world, where He actively arranges circumstances knowing how creatures would freely respond.
	•	Arminianism suggests that God’s role is more reactive, with God’s predestination being a response to what He foreknows will happen rather than Him arranging circumstances to bring about those foreknown free decisions.

In terms of their fit with your existing theological framework, both views could be made compatible with the block theory of time, as they both affirm that God knows the future without determining it by force. The choice between them may come down to how proactive you believe God is in the specifics of history and human decision-making.

Would you like to adopt one of these views, or would you prefer to reflect on them further before making a decision?

Prompt: What are the common criticisms of these two positions, whether directed from persons of one view against the other, or by theologians outside either view?

AI Reply: Both Molinism and Arminianism have faced criticisms from various theological perspectives. Here are some of the common criticisms directed at each:

Criticisms of Molinism:
	1.	Divine Manipulation: Some critics argue that Molinism’s concept of middle knowledge allows God to manipulate circumstances to ensure certain free decisions, which seems to infringe upon genuine human freedom.
	2.	Complexity and Speculation: The Molinist framework, especially the concept of middle knowledge, is seen by some as a speculative and complex system that goes beyond clear biblical revelation.
	3.	Problems with Counterfactuals: Molinism relies heavily on counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (statements about what free creatures would do under hypothetical circumstances). Critics argue that these counterfactuals lack grounding—there is no clear basis for how they are true or determined.
	4.	Compatibility with Scripture: Some theologians contend that the intricate distinctions made by Molinism do not reflect the straightforward teaching of Scripture regarding God’s sovereignty and human responsibility.

Criticisms of Arminianism:
	1.	Diluted Sovereignty: Critics, particularly from the Reformed tradition, argue that Arminianism diminishes God’s sovereignty by making His plans contingent upon human decisions.
	2.	Problem of Foreknowledge and Free Will: Critics claim that if God’s foreknowledge is infallible, then the future is fixed and human free will is illusory, as God’s knowledge of future choices would seem to necessitate them.
	3.	Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism Accusations: Some accuse Arminianism of being too close to Pelagianism or Semi-Pelagianism by overemphasizing human ability and decision in the process of salvation.
	4.	Efficacy of the Atonement: Some argue that the Arminian view potentially leads to a limited view of the atonement, as it suggests Christ’s sacrifice is only potentially effective and dependent on human response.

Both views also face external criticisms, such as:
	•	Scriptural Interpretation: Both are often criticized for their interpretations of key biblical passages related to predestination and election, with opponents arguing that they either take passages out of context or ignore the full counsel of Scripture.
	•	Philosophical Assumptions: Critics argue that both positions may be influenced more by philosophical assumptions about free will and foreknowledge than by a plain reading of Scripture.
	•	Practical Implications: Some critics focus on the implications that these views have for evangelism, discipleship, and pastoral care, questioning whether they provide a sufficient basis for hope, assurance, and motivation in the Christian life.

When considering these criticisms, it’s important to determine which critiques you find compelling and how they align with your broader theological system, especially with your commitments regarding God’s omniscience, human freedom, and the nature of salvation. Would you like to explore how any of these criticisms might impact your choice between Molinism and Arminianism?

Prompt: What defense would an Arminianist offer to these criticisms?

AI reply: An Arminian theologian might offer several defenses to address these criticisms:
	1.	Diluted Sovereignty: Arminians argue that God’s sovereignty is not diminished by human free will. They claim that God, in His sovereignty, chose to create beings with genuine freedom as an act of love, thus sovereignty includes God’s control over the circumstances of free choices, not the choices themselves.
	2.	Problem of Foreknowledge and Free Will: Arminians would defend that God’s foreknowledge does not necessitate human actions. They argue that God knows what free creatures will do without causing those actions. Foreknowledge is akin to an observer knowing what will happen but not determining it.
	3.	Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism Accusations: Arminians firmly reject Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism, emphasizing that grace is necessary for any step towards salvation. They maintain that while humans must respond to God’s grace, this response is itself enabled by prevenient grace, which restores free will.
	4.	Efficacy of the Atonement: In response to this criticism, Arminians affirm the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement for all and its effectiveness for those who believe. They argue that universal atonement demonstrates God’s love for all people and His desire that all be saved, aligning with passages that speak of God’s universal salvific will.

Additionally, regarding scriptural interpretation, Arminians contend that their views are biblically grounded, emphasizing the themes of love, choice, and relational dynamics throughout Scripture. They would argue that their interpretation of Scripture does a better job of upholding the character of God as loving and just, as well as preserving human responsibility.

Regarding philosophical assumptions, Arminians often argue that their views are less philosophically driven and more biblically faithful, claiming that their emphasis on free will is rooted in a plain reading of the biblical narrative, which portrays humans as capable of making meaningful choices.

In terms of practical implications, Arminians might claim that their theology provides a more hopeful and relational understanding of God, where salvation is a cooperative process that preserves the dignity and responsibility of human beings.

Arminianism, like any theological system, has its nuances and variations, and different proponents may offer different nuances in their responses to these criticisms. Would you like to delve into how these defenses align with your developing theological system, or would you prefer to explore another attribute or concept within systematic theology?

Prompt: Develop what scriptures and Arminianist would provide to ground this view in scripture.

AI Reply: An Arminian theologian would cite various scriptures to support their views on free will, God’s universal love, and conditional election. Here are some key passages they might reference:
	1.	Human Free Will and Responsibility
	•	Deuteronomy 30:19-20 - God presents a choice between life and death, blessing and curse, urging the people to choose life.
	•	Joshua 24:15 - Joshua tells the people to choose whom they will serve, implying they have the ability to choose.
	2.	Universal Atonement and God’s Love for All
	•	John 3:16 - God loved the world so much that He sent His only Son, indicating God’s love for all humanity.
	•	1 Timothy 2:4 - God desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
	•	2 Peter 3:9 - God is patient, not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance.
	3.	The Role of Grace and the Human Response
	•	Ephesians 2:8-9 - Salvation is by grace through faith, not from ourselves; it is the gift of God.
	•	John 1:12-13 - To all who receive Christ, who believe in His name, He gives the right to become children of God.
	•	Revelation 3:20 - Jesus stands at the door and knocks; if anyone hears His voice and opens the door, He will come in.
	4.	Conditional Election Based on Foreknowledge
	•	Romans 8:29 - Foreknew and predestined to be conformed to the likeness of His Son.
	•	1 Peter 1:2 - Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father.
	5.	Warnings Against Apostasy Indicating the Need for Endurance in Faith
	•	Hebrews 6:4-6 - The warning against falling away after having received the light.
	•	2 Peter 2:20-22 - The danger of entanglement in the world after escaping the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
	6.	The Call to Repentance and Faith as Response
	•	Acts 2:38 - Peter’s call to repentance and baptism.
	•	Mark 1:15 - The call to repent and believe the good news.
	7.	The Parables and Teachings of Jesus Indicating Choice
	•	Luke 15:11-32 - The parable of the prodigal son, who chooses to return to his father.
	•	Matthew 22:1-14 - The parable of the wedding banquet, which ends with “For many are invited, but few are chosen,” implying a response is necessary.

Arminian theologians argue that these and other scriptures depict a God who provides grace to all, desires all to be saved, and has provided the means for salvation universally. However, the actualization of this salvation is contingent upon an individual’s response to that grace—a decision enabled by God’s prevenient grace which restores the ability to choose or reject Him. This scriptural grounding provides the basis for the Arminian emphasis on human free will in cooperation with divine grace.

Would you like to integrate these scriptural references into your system or delve into how they align with your current structure?

(At this point, I added an Arminian view to my system; however, later content caused me to revise this view. However, this background is important to preserve for reflection.)
