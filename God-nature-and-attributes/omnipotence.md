## Adopted Position (Provisional)

**Working Definition: Contemporary Compatibilist-Style Adjustment of Classical Omnipotence**

> God can do all that is logically possible and consistent with His nature. God’s power is expressed in a way that freely honors creaturely freedom and meaningful relationship, without any deficiency or lack in God.

Key features:

- **Classical Core Retained**  
  God’s power is unlimited with respect to all that is **logically possible** and consistent with His perfect nature.

- **Voluntary Self-Limitation**  
  God freely chooses to exercise His power in ways that:
  - Make room for **genuine creaturely freedom** and responsible action.
  - Uphold the integrity of created processes and histories.
  This is a mode of expression, not a constraint imposed from outside.

- **Interventionist Capacity**  
  You affirm that God can and does act **miraculously** within creation (special providence, signs and wonders) when it serves His wise and good purposes.

- **Intellectualism over Voluntarism**  
  God’s will follows His **wisdom** and **moral goodness**; divine action is not arbitrary fiat. Omnipotence is ordered by God’s own character.

- **Compatibilist Language (Cautious)**  
  You use "compatibilist" language to express your conviction that:
  - Divine sovereignty and human freedom are ultimately **compatible**.
  - The precise metaphysics of freedom (libertarian vs compatibilist) is still under exploration and may be clarified more fully in `predestination.md` and `salvation.md`.

This account is held **provisionally** and may be refined as you work further on providence, freedom, and the problem of evil.

## Open Questions / Deferred Issues

You treat the following as open or in-progress (see also `God-nature-and-attributes-notes.md` and `omnipotence-notes.md`):

- How exactly to formulate **voluntary self-limitation** so that it:
  - Avoids suggesting any weakness, lack, or frustration in God.  
  - Clearly distinguishes between what God **could** do and what He **chooses** to do.
- How your view of omnipotence interfaces with:
  - Molinist middle knowledge and the ordering of possible worlds.
  - The **problem of evil**, suffering, and unanswered prayer.
  - Specific doctrines of **miracles**, **signs**, and **special providence**.

This file keeps the doctrinal statement concise. Detailed argument, case studies, and exegesis can go in `omnipotence-notes.md` and in loci such as `problem-of-evil.md` and `evil-and-human-freedom.md`.
