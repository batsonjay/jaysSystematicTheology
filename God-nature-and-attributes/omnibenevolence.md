## Adopted Position (Provisional)

**Working Definition: God’s Nature as the Standard of Moral Goodness**

> God’s unchanging character is the ultimate standard of moral goodness. Goodness is objectively real, grounded neither in sheer divine fiat nor in a moral order above God, but in who God eternally is: perfectly loving, just, faithful, and true.

Key features:

- **Against Pure Voluntarism**  
  You reject the view that goodness is simply whatever God wills, without further grounding. Divine commands and actions are always expressions of God’s already-good nature.

- **Against External Moral Realism Over God**  
  You also reject the idea that God is measured by a moral standard independent of Him. There is no standard "above" God to which He must conform.

- **Objective Moral Reality**  
  Moral goodness is **real and knowable**, though our grasp is partial. God’s character provides the deepest ground of moral truths.

- **God’s Character**  
  God is:
  - Perfectly **loving** (self-giving, seeking the true good of creatures).
  - Perfectly **just** (upholding right, judging evil).  
  - Perfectly **faithful and truthful** (reliable, promise-keeping, non-deceptive).

This position is held **provisionally**, recognizing that work remains to integrate biblical, historical, and philosophical treatments of divine goodness.

## Open Questions / Deferred Issues

You treat the following as in-progress topics (see also `God-nature-and-attributes-notes.md` and `omnibenevolence-notes.md`):

- How exactly God’s essential goodness **grounds moral objectivity**:
  - Relation between God’s nature and moral truths about love, justice, and holiness.  
  - How divine goodness relates to **wrath, judgment, and punishment**.
- How to integrate this account of goodness with:
  - The **problem of evil** and horrendous suffering.  
  - Debates about **exclusivism, inclusivism, and hopeful universalism**.
- How best to characterize the relation between divine goodness and **divine glory**:
  - Is glory primarily the radiance of this goodness?  
  - How does that affect language about God creating "for His glory"?

This file intentionally keeps the doctrinal statement concise. Extended reflection and detailed argumentation can go in `omnibenevolence-notes.md` and in loci such as `problem-of-evil.md` and `salvation.md`.
