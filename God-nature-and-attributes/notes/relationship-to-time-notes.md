# God’s Relationship to Time – Notes

_Notes specific to God’s relation to time, complementing the concise adopted position in `relationship-to-time.md`. Use this file for pasted readings, exploratory arguments, and historical/comparative work on time and eternity._

---

## 1. Orientation

Current working picture (see `relationship-to-time.md` for the normalized statement):

- Created time is a **space-time block** (eternalism) in which all moments—past, present, and future—are equally real.
- God exists in **meta-time**, from which He views and sustains the entire block, while also acting within cosmic time in genuinely sequential, relational ways.
- This is held **tentatively** and compared against more classical models of divine eternity and temporality.

## 2. Connections to Other Files

- `God-nature-and-attributes-notes.md` – contains broader study agenda items on time and eternity.
- `God-and-time.md` – now serves as a short pointer to this mini-locus; the substantive content has been integrated here.

Use this notes file to:
- Paste in quotations and summaries from Polkinghorne and other philosophers/theologians of time.
- Compare **A-theory vs B-theory**, **Boethian timelessness**, and other models to your adopted block-universe-with-meta-time view.
- Work through how this model interacts with omniscience, providence, prayer, and creaturely freedom.

## 3. Survey of Models and Key Thinkers (Integrated from `God-and-time.md`)

### 3.1 Eternalism and the Block Universe

**Definition**: Eternalism (also known as the Block Universe theory) is a philosophical model of time in which **past, present, and future all equally exist**. Time is seen as a fourth dimension akin to space, and the universe is a fixed four-dimensional block — with all events already “laid out.”

**Key Principles of Eternalism**

- The flow of time is an illusion of human perception.
- Temporal becoming is not an objective feature of reality.
- All points in time are ontologically equivalent.

**Implications for Theology**

- Supports the idea that God sees all of history “at once.”
- Suggests God's knowledge is not foreknowledge (in the temporal sense), but rather **atemporal** knowledge of all temporal events.
- Reinforces divine immutability and omniscience.
- Challenges some accounts of libertarian free will.

**Notable Advocates**

- **John Polkinghorne** (theological integration)
- **J.M.E. McTaggart** (in original formulation)
- **Augustine** (arguably eternalist in some interpretations)
- Many philosophers in the "B-theory" of time tradition

### 3.2 Polkinghorne’s Theological Adaptation

**John Polkinghorne**, a physicist and Anglican theologian, adopted a theologically nuanced version of the Block Universe idea.

**Polkinghorne's Position**

- God exists **outside of created time** ("meta-time") but **interacts dynamically with creation**, which experiences time linearly.
- Creation is embedded in a temporal unfolding process.
- God perceives the entire block but also **acts within it**, not as a frozen observer but as one engaging with a growing world.

**Key Ideas**

- God is **eternal** but not **timeless** in the strict Boethian sense.
- God's knowledge is not passively deterministic but relationally dynamic.
- Free will is real within creation, yet God eternally knows all outcomes.

**Theological Benefits (as you see them)**

- Preserves both God's **sovereignty** and **human freedom**.
- Avoids the "frozen God" critique of some classical theism.
- Allows divine responsiveness while maintaining omniscience.

---

### 3.3 William Lane Craig’s Presentist View (Contrast)

William Lane Craig strongly rejects the Block Universe view.

**Craig’s Position**

- Defends **A-theory of time** (Presentism): only the present is real.
- Argues that God exists in **real, flowing time**.
- God's knowledge of future contingents is **foreknowledge**, not atemporal awareness.

**Key Claims**

- A temporal God is necessary for relationality and love.
- The universe began to exist, and God’s act of creation marks the beginning of time.
- Time is a dynamic unfolding, not a static block.

**Critiques of Eternalism (from Craig)**

- Denies genuine becoming and change.
- Risks making human freedom and responsibility illusory.
- Allegedly incompatible with divine responsiveness and personal relationship.

### 3.4 Philosophical and Theological Comparison

| Feature                     | Eternalism / Polkinghorne        | Presentism / Craig            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Ontology of Time            | All moments equally real         | Only present is real          |
| God’s Relation to Time      | Outside time (meta-time)         | Inside flowing time           |
| Free Will                   | Affirmed (with nuance)           | Affirmed (typically libertarian) |
| Omniscience                 | Atemporal knowledge of all time  | Temporal foreknowledge        |
| Immutability                | Strong (unchanging nature)       | Weaker (relational change)    |
| Divine Action               | Responsive within the block      | Responsive in real time       |

### 3.5 Timelessness and Boethian Models

**Boethian View**

- God exists entirely **outside** of time.
- Time is a created dimension; God sees all events “in a single glance.”
- God does not experience sequence or succession.

**Polkinghorne's Adjustment (as you appropriate it)**

- God is eternal **but not static**.
- Experiences **meta-temporal succession** — God is not "in" time but still acts sequentially relative to creation.
- This avoids the charge of a “frozen” God and allows responsive action.

### 3.6 Adapting the Kalam Cosmological Argument

**Classical Kalam (Craig’s Version)**

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.  
2. The universe began to exist.  
3. Therefore, the universe has a cause (God).  
4. That cause must be outside time and space and must transcend the universe.  
5. Hence, God exists outside time and creates the universe from nothing.

**Adapted Kalam (Polkinghorne-Informed, as adopted in this system)**

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.  
2. The universe began to exist and unfolds as a temporally embedded block.  
3. Therefore, the universe has a cause — a Creator external to created time.  
4. God exists in **meta-time**, observing the full block (past/present/future) and acting within it.  
5. God’s causality is not limited to the temporal beginning but includes sustaining and interacting with all events.  
6. Therefore, God is both transcendent (creating the block) and immanently involved (responsive within the block).

**Perceived Benefit**

- Maintains the force of the Kalam argument for a transcendent Creator, while adjusting the metaphysical assumptions about time to harmonize with Eternalism and a dynamic divine nature.

---

### 3.7 Final Adopted View (Summary)

Within this system, you adopt:

- **Polkinghorne’s adaptation of the Block Universe view** as the best metaphysical model of God’s relationship to time.  
- God exists in **meta-time**, perceiving and interacting with all moments.  
- God is not timeless in the classical Boethian sense, but **eternal and relational**.

This view is chosen because it seems to preserve:

- Divine **omniscience** (complete, at-once knowledge of the whole temporal order).
- **Human freedom** (within a temporally real creation, in concert with Molinism).
- **Divine action** (responsive, not frozen).  
- The usefulness of the **Kalam** argument (in its adapted form).

This summary complements the briefer doctrinal statement in `relationship-to-time.md` and should be kept in sync with it as your view develops.

## 4. Physics and the Block Universe

In relation to Eternalism and the Block Universe, you currently understand the state of physics roughly as follows:

1. **Physics Does Not Prevent the Block Universe**  
   - Special Relativity (Minkowski spacetime) and General Relativity (4D curved spacetime) are naturally formulated as entire 4‑dimensional spacetimes.  
   - The equations describe whole space–time histories; they do not contain a built‑in “moving now” or an objective edge of reality where the present advances.  
   - Relativistic Quantum Field Theory also treats fields over 4D spacetime, which again fits naturally with a block‑style picture.

2. **Physics Does Not Strictly Entail the Block Universe Either**  
   - From the raw mathematics you get a 4D spacetime structure.  
   - The further claim that “all times are equally real” is a metaphysical interpretation, not a theorem of SR/GR/QFT.  
   - Presentism or a “growing block” can be overlaid on the same equations only by adding extra metaphysical structure (e.g., a privileged global present or objective becoming) that the physics itself does not specify.

3. **Underdetermination with a Tilt Toward the Block Reading**  
   - Physics **underdetermines** the metaphysics of time: it neither proves nor refutes Eternalism.  
   - However, the Block Universe is a straightforward, simple reading of relativistic spacetime, whereas presentism/growing block require additional metaphysical assumptions that go beyond what the equations themselves state.

These points are provisional and meant as a working summary rather than a final philosophy of physics.
