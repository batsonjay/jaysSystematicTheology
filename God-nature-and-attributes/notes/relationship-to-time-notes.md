## 1. Orientation

Current working picture (see `relationship-to-time.md` for the normalized statement):

- Created time is a **space-time block** (eternalism) in which all moments—past, present, and future—are equally real.
- God exists in **meta-time**, from which He views and sustains the entire block, while also acting within cosmic time in genuinely sequential, relational ways.
- This is held **tentatively** and compared against more classical models of divine eternity and temporality.

## 3. Survey of Models and Key Thinkers (Integrated from `God-and-time.md`)

### 3.1 Eternalism and the Block Universe

**Definition**: Eternalism (also known as the Block Universe theory) is a philosophical model of time in which **past, present, and future all equally exist**. Time is seen as a fourth dimension akin to space, and the universe is a fixed four-dimensional block — with all events already “laid out.”

**Key Principles of Eternalism**

- The flow of time is an illusion of human perception.
- Temporal becoming is not an objective feature of reality.
- All points in time are ontologically equivalent.

**Implications for Theology**

- Supports the idea that God sees all of history “at once.”
- Suggests God's knowledge is not foreknowledge (in the temporal sense), but rather **atemporal** knowledge of all temporal events.
- Reinforces divine immutability and omniscience.
- Challenges some accounts of libertarian free will.

**Notable Advocates**

- **John Polkinghorne** (theological integration)
- **J.M.E. McTaggart** (in original formulation)
- **Augustine** (arguably eternalist in some interpretations)
- Many philosophers in the "B-theory" of time tradition

### 3.2 Polkinghorne’s Theological Adaptation

**John Polkinghorne**, a physicist and Anglican theologian, adopted a theologically nuanced version of the Block Universe idea.

**Polkinghorne's Position**

- God exists **outside of created time** ("meta-time") but **interacts dynamically with creation**, which experiences time linearly.
- Creation is embedded in a temporal unfolding process.
- God perceives the entire block but also **acts within it**, not as a frozen observer but as one engaging with a growing world.

**Key Ideas**

- God is **eternal** but not **timeless** in the strict Boethian sense.
- God's knowledge is not passively deterministic but relationally dynamic.
- Free will is real within creation, yet God eternally knows all outcomes.

**Theological Benefits (as you see them)**

- Preserves both God's **sovereignty** and **human freedom**.
- Avoids the "frozen God" critique of some classical theism.
- Allows divine responsiveness while maintaining omniscience.

**Polkinghorne Background**
John Polkinghorne was a unique figure in the dialogue between science and theology. Trained as a theoretical physicist, he contributed to the understanding of particle physics before becoming an Anglican priest and theologian. His work focuses on reconciling Christian theology with the scientific understanding of the universe, including time.

Here are some key points from Polkinghorne’s perspective on God and time, particularly as they relate to eternalism and the block universe theory:

Critical Realism:
	•	Polkinghorne advocated for “critical realism,” a philosophical approach that acknowledges the reality of the world as it is revealed by science while also affirming that there is a deeper reality as revealed by theology. This approach allows him to take seriously the scientific understanding of time while also considering theological implications.

God’s Interaction with Time:
	•	He rejected the notion of a completely timeless God, which he felt was incompatible with the dynamic and relational God of Christian experience and the Incarnation, where God enters into human history.
	•	Instead, Polkinghorne suggested a God who interacts with time, one who has knowledge of future possibilities rather than fixed certainties, allowing for genuine human freedom and a relational divine nature.

Kenotic Creation:
	•	His idea of kenosis (self-emptying, from Philippians 2:7) applies to creation itself; he proposed that God allows creation to “be itself,” which includes the unfolding of the universe in time.
	•	This kenotic understanding leaves room for a universe that is not entirely predetermined but has an open future that even God chooses to experience moment by moment.

Quantum Theory and Time:
	•	Polkinghorne used insights from quantum mechanics, which allows for indeterminacy at a fundamental level, to argue that the future is not completely knowable.
	•	He believed this could provide a framework for understanding divine knowledge as fully informed about the probabilities of future events, without being deterministic.

Eschatology:
	•	When discussing eschatology (the study of the end times), Polkinghorne embraced the concept of “eschatological verification,” which means that certain Christian claims, such as the resurrection and eternal life, will be verified at the end of time.
	•	He also held that a new creation would not be bound by the current laws of physics and could be a realm where God’s timeless eternity and temporal creation come together.

Polkinghorne’s views present a God deeply engaged with the temporal process of the universe, offering a vision of creation that is open, interactive, and full of genuine possibilities. His integration of science and theology provides a model for how one can affirm the insights of both fields without reducing one to the other.

### 3.3 William Lane Craig’s Presentist View (Contrast)

William Lane Craig strongly rejects the Block Universe view.

**Craig’s Position**

- Defends **A-theory of time** (Presentism): only the present is real.
- Argues that God exists in **real, flowing time**.
- God's knowledge of future contingents is **foreknowledge**, not atemporal awareness.

**Key Claims**

- A temporal God is necessary for relationality and love.
- The universe began to exist, and God’s act of creation marks the beginning of time.
- Time is a dynamic unfolding, not a static block.

**Critiques of Eternalism (from Craig)**

- Denies genuine becoming and change.
- Risks making human freedom and responsibility illusory.
- Allegedly incompatible with divine responsiveness and personal relationship.

**Craig Background**

William Lane Craig is a well-known Christian philosopher, theologian, and apologist with a significant body of work that includes the defense of classical theism and the Kalam Cosmological Argument. His views on God and time are carefully argued in light of both philosophical reasoning and theological commitment.

Here’s an overview of Craig’s perspective:

God’s Timelessness and Temporality:
	•	Craig has argued extensively for a nuanced view where God is timeless sans (without) creation and temporal subsequent to creation. This means that before God created the universe, God existed alone without time, in a changeless state. Once God created the universe, He entered into time and now experiences temporal succession along with the universe.

The Kalam Cosmological Argument:
	•	This argument plays a key role in Craig’s understanding of God and time. It posits that the universe has a beginning and therefore requires a cause for its existence. This cause, Craig argues, is God, who chose to create the universe in a temporal act, bringing time into existence concurrently with the universe.

Tense Theory of Time (A-Theory):
	•	Craig endorses the A-Theory of time, also known as the tensed theory of time, which asserts that the distinction between past, present, and future is a real and objective aspect of the universe. This contrasts with the B-Theory or tenseless theory, which is more in line with the block universe model where all points in time are equally real.

Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom:
	•	In addressing divine foreknowledge, Craig contends that God, being omniscient, knows all future events. However, this knowledge does not negate human free will. Craig employs Molinism, a doctrine which reconciles divine foreknowledge with human freedom by positing God’s middle knowledge (scientia media) — knowledge of all true counterfactual statements — allowing Him to know what any free agent would freely choose under any given set of circumstances.

Implications of God Entering Time:
	•	By engaging with the concept of God entering into time, Craig allows for a dynamic relationship between God and the world. It suggests that God is not indifferent to temporal events and is capable of interacting with humanity in a genuine dialogue.

Eschatology and Time:
	•	Craig’s views on eschatology are traditionally Christian in that he believes in a historical resurrection and eternal life. He has discussed at length the nature of time in the afterlife, suggesting that time could be qualitatively different but will still be a sequence of moments.

Craig’s work is deeply philosophical and engages with complex issues related to metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of time. His commitment to classical theism, while still engaging with time in a meaningful way, provides a robust framework for those looking to maintain a traditional Christian doctrinal stance while also wanting to engage with sophisticated philosophical arguments.

### 3.4A Direct Contrast - Polkinghorne vs Craig
Constructing a comparison between John Polkinghorne and William Lane Craig on the nature of God’s relationship with time will provide a detailed examination of their distinct perspectives. Here is a comparative overview based on key theological and philosophical issues:

God’s Relationship to Time:
	•	Polkinghorne: Advocates for a God who is in time and experiences temporal events. This view sees God’s interaction with the world as dynamic and unfolding.
	•	Craig: Argues for a God who is timeless sans creation and enters time upon creation. This view maintains that God is essentially timeless but engages with temporal events since the moment of creation.

The Nature of Divine Foreknowledge:
	•	Polkinghorne: Suggests a form of divine knowledge that is compatible with the openness of the future. God knows all possibilities and probabilities but not necessarily all certainties of future events.
	•	Craig: Maintains that God has complete foreknowledge of the future, which is compatible with human free will through the concept of middle knowledge (Molinism).

Scientific and Philosophical Underpinnings:
	•	Polkinghorne: His approach is heavily influenced by his background in physics and his understanding of quantum mechanics, which posits an inherent unpredictability at the fundamental level of the universe.
	•	Craig: Grounds his arguments in classical philosophy, especially the A-Theory of time, which sees the future as a real and growing part of the universe, with past, present, and future as distinct entities.

Implications for the Doctrine of Creation:
	•	Polkinghorne: Emphasizes a “kenotic” creation, where God allows for a degree of autonomy in the unfolding of the universe, including indeterminacy and evolution.
	•	Craig: Affirms a classical doctrine of creation where God willfully brings the universe into being ex nihilo (out of nothing) with a predetermined plan, though this plan allows for free will.

Approach to Eschatology:
	•	Polkinghorne: Open to speculative and progressive ideas about the afterlife and the new creation, often linking them to the concepts of quantum mechanics and a new sort of life beyond the current constraints of physical laws.
	•	Craig: Adheres to a more traditional Christian eschatological view, with a historical resurrection and a definitive, eternal life that may operate under different temporal conditions but remains consistent with Christian doctrine.

Engagement with Contemporary Science:
	•	Polkinghorne: Seeks a direct dialogue with contemporary science, looking to integrate the latest findings into his theological framework.
	•	Craig: Engages with science but often through philosophical interpretation, seeking to establish a metaphysical groundwork that can accommodate scientific discoveries.

Theological Flexibility:
	•	Polkinghorne: Demonstrates a willingness to reconsider traditional doctrines in light of scientific insights, which makes his theology particularly fluid and adaptable.
	•	Craig: While open to revising philosophical arguments, tends to uphold traditional theological positions, making his approach more fixed and classical.

In summary, Polkinghorne’s view is more consonant with a process theology perspective, open to the future and emphasizing a God who is in time. Craig presents a more classical view, with a timeless God who knows the future exhaustively and enters time through the act of creation. Both scholars seek to respect the integrity of scientific inquiry while maintaining fidelity to Christian orthodoxy, though they do so in markedly different ways.


### 3.4B Clarification of Contrast
Prompt: I have at least two more questions. First, you said Craig says God was timeless sans creation, but then engages with temporal events after creation. Then you said Polkinghorne says God is in time and experiences temporal events. These sound similar; are they, or do they differ more than this summary might suggest?

AI reply:
The positions of Craig and Polkinghorne on God’s relationship with time do have similarities, but they differ in significant ways.

William Lane Craig’s Position:
Craig’s view is that God is timeless in the absence of the universe (sans creation) and only becomes temporal at the moment of creation. This means that, for Craig, there is a state of existence where God is entirely apart from time. When the universe is created, time begins, and God’s relationship to time changes — He ‘enters’ into time and becomes temporal without losing His divine nature. Thus, according to Craig, God’s temporal engagement is a direct result of the act of creation. This maintains a sort of classical theism where God is initially wholly separate from the physical universe and its properties, including time.

John Polkinghorne’s Position:
Polkinghorne suggests that God is not outside of time at any point but rather always in time, experiencing each moment sequentially. His view allows for a concept of God who interacts with the world in a dynamic way, akin to the process theology view where God and the world are in a relationship of mutual influence. This does not mean that God changes in His essence, but rather that God is responsive and experiences events as they unfold.

The key difference is in the implication of what it means for God to be timeless or temporal. For Craig, God’s timelessness is a state that exists only prior to creation. For Polkinghorne, God’s temporality is an eternal characteristic of His nature, even if that nature is not constrained by time in the way that creatures are.

Additionally, the two thinkers diverge on what this means for divine foreknowledge and action. Craig maintains traditional foreknowledge, while Polkinghorne allows for a more open future. These differences reflect deeper theological commitments about the nature of God and how He interacts with the world He has made.

Prompt: Can Polkinghorne’s view be held if one also ascribes to the Kalam proof for God’s existence?

AI Reply: The Kalam Cosmological Argument, particularly as formulated by William Lane Craig, asserts that everything that begins to exist has a cause, the universe began to exist, and therefore the universe has a cause. This cause is posited to be God, who is timeless without the universe and temporal with the universe.

John Polkinghorne’s view of God being in time does not necessarily conflict with the Kalam Argument’s conclusion that the universe has a cause outside itself. However, it does potentially conflict with the philosophical underpinnings that Craig uses to expound the Kalam Argument, specifically the notion of God being timeless sans the universe.

Polkinghorne’s perspective does not emphasize God’s timelessness apart from creation in the same way Craig does. Polkinghorne sees God as always being in some kind of relationship with time, even if it’s not within the physical time of our universe. According to Polkinghorne, God could still be the cause of the universe, but His nature isn’t defined by a transition from timelessness to temporality.

So, while one could hold to a version of the Kalam Argument and still maintain that God is in some way temporal (as the argument is fundamentally about the need for a cause of the universe rather than the nature of God’s relationship with time), this would require a reworking of some of the philosophical assumptions that Craig attaches to the argument. Polkinghorne’s view would fit with a form of the Kalam Argument that allows for God’s temporal experience before creation, though this is not the form Craig defends.

To reconcile Polkinghorne’s view with the Kalam Cosmological Argument, one would have to adapt the argument to allow for a conception of God who is always in time, rather than one who becomes temporal at the moment of creation. This might involve rethinking the nature of causality and the attributes of the causal agent (God) in creating the universe. Would you like to explore how this adaptation might look, or do you have another question?

Prompt: Yup - explore that adaptation.

AI Reply: Adapting the Kalam Cosmological Argument to accommodate Polkinghorne’s view of God as always in time involves a few philosophical shifts:

1. The Nature of Time:
Instead of viewing God’s relationship to time as changing (from timeless to temporal), we might conceive of God as existing within a sort of metaphysical time — a sequence of moments not identical with, but analogous to, our physical time. This “time” is not the time of our universe but a way of understanding God’s eternal life as a sequence of moments through which He can enact His will.

2. The Nature of Causality:
For the universe to begin to exist, its cause must have the power to initiate its existence. In Polkinghorne’s view, God is the ground of all being and, thus, capable of causing the universe even if He experiences His own divine “moments.” This causality doesn’t depend on God being timeless but on God being capable of action, which is not inherently dependent on timelessness.

3. The Divine Relationship with the Universe:
Polkinghorne could agree that the universe has a beginning and a Cause, but would understand God’s act of creation as something that unfolds in God’s experience of metaphysical time. In other words, God’s decision and act of creating are not “before” time in a temporal sense but are foundational to time as we experience it.

4. Divine Foreknowledge and Omniscience:
In a Polkinghorne-adapted Kalam, God’s omniscience would include knowledge of all that could possibly happen (potential knowledge) and all that is happening (actual knowledge). The future could be seen as a realm of possibilities that God fully understands and within which God operates, rather than a set of fixed certainties known in advance.

5. Theological Implications:
This view maintains God’s sovereignty and the created nature of the universe while also allowing for a more relational understanding of God’s interaction with creation. It suggests a God who is intimately involved with creation, experiencing its unfolding in a way that is compatible with His omniscience and omnipotence.

By adapting the Kalam Argument in this way, one can maintain that God is the cause of the universe without insisting that God is timeless sans creation. This creates a version of the argument that is less focused on the philosophical implications of timelessness and more on the relational and dynamic nature of God’s interaction with the universe.

This adapted argument aligns more closely with Polkinghorne’s views and would suit those who are comfortable with a concept of God that allows for a more temporally engaged and responsive deity, without compromising on the conviction that God is the necessary cause of all that exists.

(Result: I assigned this adapted view to my system for now.)

### 3.5 Timelessness and Boethian Models

**Boethian View**

- God exists entirely **outside** of time.
- Time is a created dimension; God sees all events “in a single glance.”
- God does not experience sequence or succession.

**Polkinghorne's Adjustment (as you appropriate it)**

- God is eternal **but not static**.
- Experiences **meta-temporal succession** — God is not "in" time but still acts sequentially relative to creation.
- This avoids the charge of a “frozen” God and allows responsive action.

---

### 3.6 Adapting the Kalam Cosmological Argument

**Classical Kalam (Craig’s Version)**

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.  
2. The universe began to exist.  
3. Therefore, the universe has a cause (God).  
4. That cause must be outside time and space and must transcend the universe.  
5. Hence, God exists outside time and creates the universe from nothing.

**Adapted Kalam (Polkinghorne-Informed, as adopted in this system)**

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.  
2. The universe began to exist and unfolds as a temporally embedded block.  
3. Therefore, the universe has a cause — a Creator external to created time.  
4. God exists in **meta-time**, observing the full block (past/present/future) and acting within it.  
5. God’s causality is not limited to the temporal beginning but includes sustaining and interacting with all events.  
6. Therefore, God is both transcendent (creating the block) and immanently involved (responsive within the block).

**Perceived Benefit**

- Maintains the force of the Kalam argument for a transcendent Creator, while adjusting the metaphysical assumptions about time to harmonize with Eternalism and a dynamic divine nature.

---

### 3.7 Final Adopted View (Summary)

Within this system, you adopt:

- **Polkinghorne’s adaptation of the Block Universe view** as the best metaphysical model of God’s relationship to time.  
- God exists in **meta-time**, perceiving and interacting with all moments.  
- God is not timeless in the classical Boethian sense, but **eternal and relational**.

This view is chosen because it seems to preserve:

- Divine **omniscience** (complete, at-once knowledge of the whole temporal order).
- **Human freedom** (within a temporally real creation, in concert with Molinism).
- **Divine action** (responsive, not frozen).  
- The usefulness of the **Kalam** argument (in its adapted form).

This summary complements the briefer doctrinal statement in `relationship-to-time.md` and should be kept in sync with it as your view develops.

## 4. Physics and the Block Universe

In relation to Eternalism and the Block Universe, you currently understand the state of physics roughly as follows:

1. **Physics Does Not Prevent the Block Universe**  
   - Special Relativity (Minkowski spacetime) and General Relativity (4D curved spacetime) are naturally formulated as entire 4‑dimensional spacetimes.  
   - The equations describe whole space–time histories; they do not contain a built‑in “moving now” or an objective edge of reality where the present advances.  
   - Relativistic Quantum Field Theory also treats fields over 4D spacetime, which again fits naturally with a block‑style picture.

2. **Physics Does Not Strictly Entail the Block Universe Either**  
   - From the raw mathematics you get a 4D spacetime structure.  
   - The further claim that “all times are equally real” is a metaphysical interpretation, not a theorem of SR/GR/QFT.  
   - Presentism or a “growing block” can be overlaid on the same equations only by adding extra metaphysical structure (e.g., a privileged global present or objective becoming) that the physics itself does not specify.

3. **Underdetermination with a Tilt Toward the Block Reading**  
   - Physics **underdetermines** the metaphysics of time: it neither proves nor refutes Eternalism.  
   - However, the Block Universe is a straightforward, simple reading of relativistic spacetime, whereas presentism/growing block require additional metaphysical assumptions that go beyond what the equations themselves state.

These points are provisional and meant as a working summary rather than a final philosophy of physics.
