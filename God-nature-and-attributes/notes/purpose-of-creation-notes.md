## 1. Orientation

Current working picture (see `purpose-of-creation.md` for the normalized statement):

- God created the universe as a **generous outflow of His love**.
- God seeks **free and loving relationship** with conscious beings.
- God delights in the **flourishing of life, creativity, and diversity**.
- Creation is **not** motivated by divine need or lack; it expresses God’s fullness, not deficiency.
- Talk of God creating "for His glory" is affirmed but interpreted as: God’s glory is the **radiant manifestation** of His loving, wise, and good character.
