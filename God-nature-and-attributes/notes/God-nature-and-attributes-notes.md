# God: Nature and Attributes – Notes

_These notes collect background, development history, and study agendas related to the normalized doctrine file in `God-nature-and-attributes.md`. They preserve material from earlier drafts that would clutter the main locus, while keeping it available for future revision._

## 1. Overview of Current Framework (Informal)

From the earlier drafts, the working picture of God’s nature and attributes can be summarized informally as:

- God is **necessary, uncaused, immaterial, personal, and self-existent (aseity)**.
- God is **maximally great** in power, knowledge, goodness, and being.
- A **qualified divine simplicity** is affirmed: God is not composed of parts, but His perfections can be distinguished conceptually and in their relational expression.
- Regarding **time**, you adopt a **Polkinghorne-style Block Universe / Eternalism with meta-time**:
  - All moments of created time—past, present, future—are equally real in the space-time “block.”
  - God is not strictly timeless nor simply “within” created time, but exists in **meta-time**, from which He views and engages the entire temporal order.
  - God’s omniscience includes the whole of time “at once,” while God’s actions are genuinely relational in the temporal sequence.
- Regarding **knowledge**, you now affirm **Molinist middle knowledge**:
  - God knows all possibilities and all counterfactuals of creaturely freedom.
  - God sovereignly actualizes a world including free choices, without causally determining them.
- Regarding **presence**, you adopt a **Punctiliar Presence** view:
  - God is fully present at every point in space-time—not spread out or merely metaphorically present.
  - Presence is personal and relationally immediate, though not always manifest.
- Regarding **power**, you affirm a **contemporary adjustment of classical omnipotence**:
  - God can do all that is logically possible and consistent with His nature.
  - Voluntary self-limitation for the sake of creaturely freedom and meaningful relationship.
  - God can intervene miraculously; divine will follows divine wisdom and goodness (intellectualism over sheer voluntarism).
- Regarding **goodness**, you adopt a **middle position**:
  - Rejecting both pure voluntarism and a moral standard external to God.
  - God’s own unchanging character is the standard of moral goodness.
- Regarding **love**, you lean **Christological / soteriological exclusivist** (to be further developed under salvation), held together with your Molinism and block-universe-with-meta-time view.

The normalized doctrine file restates and organizes these commitments more cleanly and systematically.

## 2. Development of Views (Historical Notes)

This section preserves “how you got here” from earlier drafts.

### 2.1 Omniscience: From Simple Foreknowledge to Molinism

From `God-nature-and-attributes-1.md`:

> You replaced your earlier Arminian view with this.
> 
> Prior Arminian view (simple foreknowledge): God infallibly foreknows future free choices without determining them; providence is responsive rather than strongly actualizing via counterfactuals (no middle-knowledge grounding).

The doctrine file now simply states the adopted Molinist position; this historical note is retained here as background to your own theological journey.

### 2.2 Time and Meta-Time

Material preserved from both drafts:

- You have adopted **John Polkinghorne’s Block Universe / Eternalism view** of time:
  - God exists in **meta-time** and views all of created time as an extended present (the block).
  - God is dynamically involved in temporal events and **experiences the unfolding of time** with creatures, while also having an at-once grasp of the whole.
- You reconcile this with the **Kalam Cosmological Argument** roughly as follows:
  - God existed in a **meta-time** state “before” creation.
  - Upon creating the universe, God stands in relation to **cosmic time**, engaging with the created temporal order while remaining in meta-time.
- Earlier draft list of follow-up topics (now also reflected in Open Questions):
  - Boethian timelessness
  - A-theory vs. B-theory of time
  - Formal study and critique of the Block Universe model

### 2.3 God’s Love and Exclusivism

From the earlier drafts:

- One draft said: “You currently lean Exclusivist regarding salvation through Christ alone, pending fuller exploration of salvation and human freedom.”
- A later draft, after adopting Molinism, recorded:

> You have adopted the **Exclusivist view** of God’s love, aligned with your Molinist theology:
> - God’s love is real for all, but **redemptive love** is particularly efficacious toward those who respond in faith.
> - You lean toward a **Polkinghorne-style temporal relationship**, in which God’s love is experienced **within** time and creation, not just beyond it.
> 
> _(Note: A prior flag to revisit this based on predestination was removed after switching to Molinism.)_

The doctrine file summarizes this as a **provisional adopted position** and pushes the detailed soteriological questions to the loci on **salvation** and **predestination**.

## 3. Study Agenda and Open Research Questions

These items come from the earlier “Current Open Topics” and “Follow-up Topics to Explore Later,” plus a few obvious extensions. They are mirrored in shorter form in the doctrine file’s **Open Questions** section, but retained here in fuller list form to guide future study.

### 3.1 Divine Nature and Classical Attributes

- **Divine Simplicity**
  - Clarify and possibly formalize a **qualified** (non-modal collapse) account of simplicity.
  - How to speak of distinct attributes without implying composition.
- **Immutability and Impassibility**
  - How to reconcile genuine relational responsiveness (especially in meta-time + cosmic time) with a robust doctrine of immutability.
  - Whether and how to affirm some form of impassibility that is compatible with incarnation and a suffering Christ.
- **Aseity**
  - You assume God’s self-existence but have not yet explored it in depth; needs biblical, historical, and philosophical treatment.
- **Substance language of the Trinity**
  - To be addressed systematically under the doctrine of the Trinity, but closely related to how “nature” and “attributes” language works.

### 3.2 Time and Eternity

- Compare and evaluate:
  - **A-theory vs. B-theory** of time.
  - **Boethian timelessness** vs. your current meta-time + block-universe view.
  - Whether the block universe with meta-time can be rigorously articulated in contemporary philosophy of time.
- Examine whether your preferred model:
  - Preserves genuine contingency and creaturely freedom.
  - Avoids collapsing divine knowledge into deterministic necessity.
  - Coheres with biblical depictions of God’s dynamic interaction in history.

### 3.3 Omniscience and Middle Knowledge

- Work through the **grounding objection** to Molinism in detail.
- Integrate Molinism more explicitly with your loci on:
  - **Predestination**
  - **Problem of Evil / evil and human freedom**
  - **Salvation**
- Clarify your stance on **libertarian vs. compatibilist** freedom in light of Molinism and your statements about compatibilism under omnipotence.

### 3.4 Omnipotence, Freedom, and Providence

- Further clarify how your **compatibilist adjustment** of omnipotence fits with:
  - Molinist counterfactuals.
  - The reality of suffering and evil.
  - Miracles and special providence.
- Explore whether “voluntary self-limitation” language can be made precise without suggesting any lack in God.

### 3.5 Love, Goodness, and Purpose of Creation

- Deepen your account of:
  - How **God’s essential goodness** grounds moral objectivity.
  - How divine goodness relates to wrath, judgment, and justice.
- Connect your view of **God’s purpose in creating the universe** (generous outflow of love, seeking free relationship and flourishing) with:
  - Classical accounts emphasizing the **glory of God**.
  - Concerns about anthropocentrism vs. the intrinsic value of non-human creation.
- Work out a fuller view of **inclusivism/exclusivism** (and possibly hopeful universalism) in dialogue with your exclusivist leanings and Molinist commitments.

## 4. Quoted Material Preserved from Earlier Drafts

This section keeps a few verbatim formulations that may be worth reusing or revising later.

### 4.1 Purpose in Creating the Universe

From `God-nature-and-attributes-2.md`:

> “God created the universe as a generous outflow of His love, seeking free and loving relationship with conscious beings, and delighting in the flourishing of life, creativity, and diversity.”
>
> - This affirms that creation is not about divine need or coercion, but about **loving relationship** and **purposeful flourishing**.
> - You **reject glory-seeking or sovereign-display motivations** as primary drivers.

This wording is reflected (with light editing) in the doctrine file under **Implications and Pastoral Considerations**.

### 4.2 Informal Attribute Summaries

From `God-nature-and-attributes-1.md`:

> You affirm the classical view of God as:
> - Necessary
> - Uncaused
> - Immaterial
> - Personal
> - Self-existent (aseity)
> - Maximally great in power, knowledge, goodness, and being
>
> You accept divine simplicity in a qualified form: God is not composed of parts, but His perfections can be distinguished in concept and in relational expression.

This language has been paraphrased into the doctrine file as part of the **Background and Biblical Foundations / Adopted Position(s)** sections.
