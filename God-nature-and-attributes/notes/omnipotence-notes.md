## 1. Orientation

Current working picture (see `omnipotence.md` for the normalized statement):

- God can do all that is **logically possible** and consistent with His nature.
- God’s power is expressed with **voluntary self-limitation** for the sake of creaturely freedom and meaningful relationship.
- God retains full **interventionist capacity** (miracles, special providence).
- God’s will follows His **wisdom and moral goodness** (intellectualism), not arbitrary fiat.
- You cautiously employ **compatibilist** language to describe the harmony of divine sovereignty and human freedom.
