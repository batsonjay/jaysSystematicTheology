# Divine Omnipotence – Notes

_Notes specific to **divine omnipotence**, complementing the concise adopted position in `omnipotence.md`. Use this file for pasted readings, exploratory arguments, and case studies related to power, freedom, and providence._

## 1. Orientation

Current working picture (see `omnipotence.md` for the normalized statement):

- God can do all that is **logically possible** and consistent with His nature.
- God’s power is expressed with **voluntary self-limitation** for the sake of creaturely freedom and meaningful relationship.
- God retains full **interventionist capacity** (miracles, special providence).
- God’s will follows His **wisdom and moral goodness** (intellectualism), not arbitrary fiat.
- You cautiously employ **compatibilist** language to describe the harmony of divine sovereignty and human freedom.

## 4. Scratch Space

The attribute of omnipotence refers to God’s ability to do all things that are logically possible. Here’s an overview of the common perspectives and debates concerning omnipotence:
	1.	Definition of Omnipotence:
	•	Classical Definition: Traditionally, omnipotence has been defined as the power to do all things that are intrinsically possible. God can do anything that doesn’t involve a logical contradiction or an intrinsic impossibility (e.g., creating a square circle).
	•	Contemporary Adjustments: Some contemporary theologians have proposed more nuanced definitions, such as God having the greatest possible amount of power, which is still sufficient for all divine purposes, but may not include logically contradictory acts or acts that would go against God’s nature (such as lying).
	2.	God’s Omnipotence and Human Freedom:
	•	Compatibilism: This view holds that divine omnipotence is compatible with human free will. God’s sovereign power includes the ordination of free choices.
	•	Incompatibilism: Conversely, some argue that if God is truly omnipotent, human free will cannot exist because all events and decisions must be under God’s control.
	3.	God’s Omnipotence and the Problem of Evil:
	•	If God is omnipotent, why does evil exist? This is a central question in theodicy. Some argue that allowing evil can be part of a greater divine plan, while others contend that evil is a necessary possibility given free will.
	4.	Omnipotence and Natural Laws:
	•	Interventionist: This perspective holds that God can and does intervene in the world, which may include suspending natural laws.
	•	Non-interventionist: Others propose that God sustains natural laws consistently and chooses not to interrupt them, which aligns with a deistic or process theology perspective.
	5.	Omnipotence and God’s Will:
	•	Voluntarism: The belief that God’s will is the ultimate standard of good, and anything God wills is possible.
	•	Intellectualism: The belief that God’s will is informed by reason and God cannot will something that is against His rational nature.
