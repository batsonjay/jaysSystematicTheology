# Divine Omniscience – Notes

_Notes specific to **divine omniscience** and Molinist middle knowledge, complementing the concise adopted position in `omniscience.md`. Use this file for pasted readings, exploratory arguments, and historical/comparative work._

---

## 1. Orientation

Current working picture (see `omniscience.md` for the normalized statement):

- God knows all necessary truths, all possibilities, all contingent truths about the actual world, and all **counterfactuals of creaturely freedom**.
- God freely actualizes a world in light of this middle knowledge, without causally determining free choices.
- This Molinist model replaces an earlier Arminian **simple-foreknowledge** view.

Further AI discussion

AI content: Omnipresence:

The doctrine of God’s omnipresence states that God is present everywhere at all times. Here are some common views and debates on this attribute:

1. Reformed Tradition (Classical Theism):
	•	God is present in all places and times in an immaterial sense; not limited by space or physical presence, but His influence and knowledge permeate everything.

2. Pantheism:
	•	This view conflates God with the universe; God literally is everything, and thus, is present everywhere because there is no distinction between God and creation.

3. Panentheism:
	•	God is in everything, and everything is in God. Unlike Pantheism, God is more than the universe but still intimately connected with the physical world, which exists within God.

4. Open Theism:
	•	While God is present everywhere, His experience and actions are influenced by temporal events. This can imply a dynamic presence that reacts to free actions of creatures.

5. Process Theology:
	•	God’s omnipresence is not static but is constantly changing and growing as the universe and the experiences within it evolve.

6. Punctiliar Presence:
	•	God can choose to be present at specific locations and times in a more concentrated or manifest way while still being omnipresent in a general sense.

Debates around Omnipresence:
	•	Spatial vs. Non-Spatial Presence:
	•	Is God’s presence to be understood spatially (in all locations) or non-spatially (beyond the concept of physical space)?
	•	Literal vs. Figurative Presence:
	•	Should God’s presence be taken as a literal truth about His nature, or is it a figurative way to express His knowledge and influence?
	•	Presence and Sovereignty:
	•	How does God’s omnipresence relate to His sovereignty and control over the universe?
	•	Presence in Relation to Evil:
	•	How can God be present in places or situations where evil exists? This is closely related to the problem of evil in theology.

Each of these views carries different implications for how God interacts with the world and how His presence is experienced by creation.

Prompt: Assume one is advocating the punctiliar presence view. What would be one's position in those four debate areas you cited?

AI reply: If one were advocating the punctiliar presence view, here’s how they might position themselves in the four debate areas regarding God’s omnipresence:
	1.	Spatial vs. Non-Spatial Presence:
	•	A proponent of punctiliar presence may hold that God’s omnipresence is non-spatial in a general sense, meaning that God’s essence is not physically spread out across space as we understand it. However, they would also argue that God can choose to be spatially present at specific points or events in a more focused way, for example, in the Incarnation or in the Biblical account of the burning bush.
	2.	Literal vs. Figurative Presence:
	•	They would likely understand God’s general omnipresence as a literal aspect of His nature—that God is indeed “everywhere” in a non-spatial, metaphysical sense. The punctiliar aspect, however, where God manifests in specific places or events, might be seen as both literal (in terms of actual physical presence) and figurative (emphasizing the significance of the divine encounter).
	3.	Presence and Sovereignty:
	•	The advocate would maintain that God’s omnipresence underlines His sovereignty, as God’s ability to be present in specific times and places reflects His sovereign will and power to engage directly with parts of creation. This viewpoint does not compromise God’s overall sovereignty but rather illustrates it through selective, purposeful presence.
	4.	Presence in Relation to Evil:
	•	Regarding the presence of evil, they might argue that God’s punctiliar presence is an expression of His choice to confront evil and suffering directly in certain instances, while His general non-spatial presence maintains the upholding of creation and the natural order. God’s selective presence in times of distress or moral significance could be seen as a reflection of His character and a response to evil rather than a passive omnipresence.

This nuanced view allows for a God who is both immanent and transcendent, intimately involved in the minutiae of creation while also existing beyond it in a fundamental way. Would you like to include punctiliar presence in your systematic theology, or explore how it interacts with other attributes?

Prompt: I’m leaning towards adopting this. But before we take the step to add it, (a) what criticisms are typically made against this view, (b) from what persons or traditions did this view arise, and (c) is it considered ancient or modern, and is it widely favored or disfavored

AI reply: Criticisms of Punctiliar Presence:
	1.	Lack of Biblical Precedent:
Critics argue that the punctiliar presence view is not explicitly supported by biblical texts, which often affirm God’s continuous presence rather than an intermittent one.
	2.	Challenges to God’s Immutability:
The idea that God chooses when and where to be present could be seen as implying changeability in God’s nature, which conflicts with classical theism’s assertion of divine immutability.
	3.	God’s Relationship with Evil:
This view could complicate understandings of God’s relationship with evil and suffering. If God is not always actively present in a situation, some might question His involvement or concern with every aspect of creation.
	4.	Neglect of General Omnipresence:
The punctiliar presence might be critiqued for downplaying the doctrine that God’s presence is consistent and uniform, which is a comfort and assurance to many believers.

Origins and Historical Context:
	•	Biblical Narratives:
The concept is often derived from biblical narratives where God appears at particular times and places, such as the burning bush or the pillar of cloud and fire leading Israel.
	•	Theophanies and Christophanies:
The punctiliar presence is reminiscent of the specific instances in the Bible where God or Christ appears in a tangible form, known as theophanies or Christophanies.
	•	Church Fathers and Medieval Scholastics:
Early church fathers and medieval theologians touched on aspects of this concept as they explored the nature of God’s immanence and transcendence, though they did not typically articulate a punctiliar presence as a standalone doctrine.

Modern Acceptance:
	•	Ancient or Modern:
The view, as a distinct concept, is more modern, emerging from contemporary theological discussions that seek to understand God’s action within the space-time continuum.
	•	Favorability:
It is not a majority position in Christian theology and is more a point of discussion rather than a widely held doctrinal stance.

This perspective often emerges in dialogue with more process-oriented or open theistic views of God, which emphasize divine responsiveness and relationality. Would you like to consider this further, or have another question about omnipresence?

(At this point I added punticular presence to my system)
