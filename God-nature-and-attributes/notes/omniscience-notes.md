# Divine Omniscience – Notes

_Notes specific to **divine omniscience** and Molinist middle knowledge, complementing the concise adopted position in `omniscience.md`. Use this file for pasted readings, exploratory arguments, and historical/comparative work._

## 1. Orientation

Current working picture (see `omniscience.md` for the normalized statement):

- God knows all necessary truths, all possibilities, all contingent truths about the actual world, and all **counterfactuals of creaturely freedom**.
- God freely actualizes a world in light of this middle knowledge, without causally determining free choices.
- This Molinist model replaces an earlier Arminian **simple-foreknowledge** view.
