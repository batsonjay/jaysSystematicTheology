# Divine Nature – Notes

_Notes specific to God’s **aseity, simplicity, and maximal greatness**, complementing the concise adopted position in `divine-nature.md`. Use this file for pasted readings, exploratory arguments, and historical surveys. For broader God-nature-and-attributes study agendas, see `God-nature-and-attributes-notes.md`._

## 1. Orientation

Current working picture (see `divine-nature.md` for the normalized statement):

- God is **necessary, uncaused, immaterial, personal, and self-existent (aseity)**.
- God is **maximally great** in power, knowledge, goodness, and being.
- You affirm a **qualified simplicity**: God has no parts, but we can distinguish attributes conceptually and in their relational expression.

This file is deliberately informal and may contain partial arguments, quotes, and reading notes.

## 2. Connections to General Notes

The following themes are treated at a more general level in `God-nature-and-attributes-notes.md`:

- **Divine Simplicity**: questions about non-modal-collapse accounts, conceptual vs. real distinctions, and classical sources.
- **Immutability and Impassibility**: how they relate to relational responsiveness and the incarnation.
- **Aseity**: the need for deeper biblical, historical, and philosophical treatment beyond assuming it.

Use this file to:
- Copy in relevant excerpts from readings on classical theism (e.g., Augustine, Aquinas, Anselm) or analytic theism.
- Sketch your own arguments for and against specific formulations of aseity and simplicity.
