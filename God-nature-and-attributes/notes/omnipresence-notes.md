# Divine Omnipresence – Notes

## 1. Orientation

Current working picture (see `omnipresence.md` for the normalized statement):

- God is **fully and personally present** at every point in space-time.
- Omnipresence is not spatial extension like a substance; it is a mode of **personal presence**.
- This presence fits your block-universe-with-meta-time account: God is punctually present at each point in the created block while also standing in meta-time.
