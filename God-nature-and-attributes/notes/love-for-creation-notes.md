## 1. Orientation

Current working picture (see `love-for-creation.md` for the normalized statement):

- God’s love is **universally benevolent** toward all creatures, willing their good and delighting in their flourishing.
- In matters of salvation, God’s love is **redemptively particular**: salvation is through Christ alone; God’s love is real for all but efficaciously saving for those united to Christ by faith, understood within a Molinist framework.
- Creatures experience God’s love **within time**, in genuinely relational and responsive ways, grounded in God’s unchanging character in meta-time.
