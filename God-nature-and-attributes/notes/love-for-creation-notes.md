# God’s Love for Creation – Notes

## 1. Orientation

Current working picture (see `love-for-creation.md` for the normalized statement):

- God’s love is **universally benevolent** toward all creatures, willing their good and delighting in their flourishing.
- In matters of salvation, God’s love is **redemptively particular**: salvation is through Christ alone; God’s love is real for all but efficaciously saving for those united to Christ by faith, understood within a Molinist framework.
- Creatures experience God’s love **within time**, in genuinely relational and responsive ways, grounded in God’s unchanging character in meta-time.

## 4. Scratch Space

AI discussion: Definition of Good: Adopted a contemporary middle path that affirms God’s commands and nature are inherently good, avoiding the pitfalls of the Euthyphro dilemma by positing that moral truths are not arbitrary but are grounded in the consistent and perfectly good character of God.

Now, for contrasting views on God’s love for creation:
	1.	Unconditional Love (Universal Benevolence):
	•	This view holds that God loves all of His creation unconditionally, without exception or precondition. It emphasizes the passages in Scripture that speak of God’s love for the world and His desire that all be saved.
	•	Advocates: This is a common view among many modern theologians and is often tied to a universalist hope that all will eventually be reconciled to God.
	2.	Conditional Love (Selective Love):
	•	According to this perspective, God’s love is expressed in a saving way only towards those who fulfill certain conditions, such as faith in Christ. It is tied closely to the doctrine of election in Reformed theology.
	•	Advocates: Historically, this view is associated with the teachings of Augustine and later Reformers like John Calvin.
	3.	Inclusive Love (Inclusivism):
	•	Inclusivism holds that while Jesus Christ is the definitive revelation of God’s love, people can be part of God’s salvation even if they do not explicitly know Christ. This is based on the understanding that God’s grace can operate in contexts beyond explicit Christian faith.
	•	Advocates: This view is held by a number of Catholic theologians post-Vatican II and by some Protestant theologians who emphasize the universal salvific will of God.
	4.	Particular Love (Exclusivism):
	•	Exclusivism is the belief that God’s saving love is extended only to those who, through faith, accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. It stresses the necessity of conscious faith in Christ for salvation.
	•	Advocates: This view is common among evangelical Christians and reflects a traditional interpretation of passages that speak of faith in Christ as the way to salvation.
	5.	Impassibility vs. Passibility:
	•	Impassibility posits that God does not experience emotional changes prompted by creation, reflecting a love that is consistent and unchanging.
	•	Passibility suggests that God is capable of suffering and emotional change in response to the joys and sorrows of His creation.

These views on God’s love for creation often intersect with one’s understanding of salvation, divine justice, human freedom, and the problem of evil. They can inform how one approaches evangelism, interfaith dialogue, and the character of God’s interactions with humanity.

Would you like to adopt or explore one of these views further for your systematic theology?

Prompt: 2 & 4 sound similar, but your listing of them separately makes me think they have differences. If so, make them clear.

AI reply: Indeed, while Conditional Love (Selective Love) and Particular Love (Exclusivism) may sound similar because they both emphasize that God’s saving love is particularly directed, they differ in nuance and theological emphasis:
	1.	Conditional Love (Selective Love):
	•	This view tends to focus on the predestining will of God and the idea that God has elected certain individuals to salvation. It often arises from a reading of Scripture that emphasizes God’s sovereign choice in predestining some to salvation (e.g., Romans 9).
	•	The love of God here is understood as selective and intentional, aimed at an elect group. It does not necessarily deny God’s general love for all creation but distinguishes between a general love and a special saving love for the elect.
	2.	Particular Love (Exclusivism):
	•	Exclusivism focuses more on the response of the individual to the gospel of Christ. It emphasizes the need for a conscious decision to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior for salvation.
	•	While also affirming that God’s saving love is extended to those who believe, exclusivism is often framed in the context of personal accountability and the necessity of personal faith in Jesus for salvation.

In other words, the Selective Love view emphasizes God’s sovereignty and initiative in choosing whom to save, while the Exclusivism view emphasizes human responsibility and the necessity of a personal response to God’s offer of salvation. Selective Love can include a sense of mystery as to why some are chosen and others are not, whereas Exclusivism can be more focused on the clarity of the gospel call and individual responsibility to respond.

Would you like to delve deeper into any of these perspectives, or should I include a particular view on God’s love for creation in your systematic theology?

Prompt: Which if these seems to fit better with the view in my system on the relationship between God & time?

AI reply: The views on God’s love for creation can be considered largely independent of His relationship to time, but there are some connections that can be made:
	1.	Conditional Love (Selective Love):
	•	This could be seen as compatible with a view of God who knows the future exhaustively and has predetermined it, which can align with a timeless understanding of God. God’s electing love is seen as timeless, sovereign, and unchanging.
	2.	Particular Love (Exclusivism):
	•	Exclusivism can align with a view of God who is in time with us, responding to our decisions as they unfold in time. It emphasizes the temporal unfolding of God’s plan and human responses to God’s revelation in history.

Given your adoption of Polkinghorne’s Block Theory, which can suggest that God is in time with creation and knows the future as a reality rather than just a set of possibilities, the Particular Love (Exclusivism) view might resonate more with your system. It allows for a dynamic relationship between God and humanity, where human actions and responses to God’s love in time are significant and meaningful.

However, since the Block Theory also holds that all points in time are equally real to God, it doesn’t necessarily conflict with the Conditional Love (Selective Love) perspective, as God’s electing could be seen as based on His timeless knowledge of all events.

You could, therefore, reasonably incorporate either view into your system without a clear contradiction. It would depend on how you wish to emphasize God’s sovereignty and human responsibility within the framework of time and eternity you’ve adopted. Would you like to adopt one of these views on God’s love for creation, or should we explore further how each might interact with the concept of time in your systematic theology?

(At this oint I addedd Exclusivism to my system)
