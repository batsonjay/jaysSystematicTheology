## 1. Orientation

Current working picture (see `omnibenevolence.md` for the normalized statement):

- God’s **unchanging character** is the ultimate standard of moral goodness.
- Goodness is **objectively real**, grounded neither in sheer divine fiat nor in a standard above God.
- God is perfectly **loving, just, faithful, and true**; divine commands and actions always express this character.
