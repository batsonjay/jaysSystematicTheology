## 1. Orientation

Current working picture (see `omnibenevolence.md` for the normalized statement):

- God’s **unchanging character** is the ultimate standard of moral goodness.
- Goodness is **objectively real**, grounded neither in sheer divine fiat nor in a standard above God.
- God is perfectly **loving, just, faithful, and true**; divine commands and actions always express this character.

## 4. Scratch Space

AI discussion: Omnibenevolence refers to God’s all-encompassing and perfect love or goodness. This attribute is often central in discussions about the nature of God, especially in relation to the existence of evil and suffering in the world. Here are a few sub-topics and debates that arise when discussing omnibenevolence:
	1.	Definition of Good: What does it mean to say that God is good? This debate often hinges on whether goodness is defined by God’s nature or by an external standard.
	2.	God’s Love for Creation: How does God’s love manifest towards His creation? This includes debates on whether God’s love is conditional or unconditional, and how it relates to God’s justice and wrath.
	3.	Theodicy: How can a perfectly good God permit evil and suffering? Different theodicies attempt to reconcile God’s omnibenevolence with the presence of evil in the world.
	4.	Universalism vs. Particularism: Does God’s love ultimately lead to the salvation of all people (universalism), or is salvation limited to those who meet certain conditions (particularism)?
	5.	Election and Predestination: In relation to God’s love, how are the doctrines of election and predestination understood? Does God’s love mean that He has chosen some for salvation unconditionally, or is there a different mechanism at play?
	6.	Implications for Divine Action: What does God’s perfect goodness imply about divine action? For instance, can God act in ways that seem harsh or unloving to bring about a greater good?

In exploring these, you may find that your understanding of God’s omnibenevolence will influence and be influenced by other aspects of your theology, such as your views on salvation, human freedom, and the nature of sin and redemption.

Would you like to delve into any specific debate, or would you prefer an overview of how different traditions have approached the concept of omnibenevolence?

Prompt: Start from the top and discuss contrasting views on the definition of good.

AI reply: When discussing the definition of “good” in the context of God’s nature, there are primarily two contrasting views: the Divine Command Theory and the Moral Realism or Goodness as an aspect of God’s nature.
	1.	Divine Command Theory:
	•	This theory holds that something is good because God commands it; God’s will is definitive of what is good. Morality is thus grounded in the commands of God.
	•	Advocates: This view is often associated with voluntarist positions, famously supported by theologians like William of Ockham.
	•	Criticisms: Critics argue that this makes morality arbitrary—if God commanded something we consider abhorrent, would it become good? This is the Euthyphro dilemma, which questions whether an act is good because God wills it, or does God will it because it is good?
	2.	Moral Realism or Essential Goodness:
	•	Moral Realism posits that moral truths exist independently of who believes them. In the context of theology, this means that God commands things because they are good in themselves, and God’s nature is the standard of goodness.
	•	Advocates: This position is associated with philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas, who believed that God’s nature is the standard of moral goodness.
	•	Criticisms: A criticism of this view is that it could imply a standard of good outside of God to which God is subject, potentially undermining the doctrine of divine simplicity and aseity.

In contemporary discussions, many theologians try to navigate a middle path that acknowledges God’s sovereignty and the reality of moral truths. They often assert that God’s character is the embodiment of goodness and that God’s commands are not arbitrary but flow naturally from His character.

Each perspective can impact one’s view on the nature of God, ethics, and law. For example, if you adopt Divine Command Theory, then Scripture and revelation become the primary sources for ethical guidance. If you lean towards Moral Realism, then the focus might be more on the character of God and understanding morality through the lens of God’s nature as revealed in various ways, including, but not limited to, Scripture.

Would you like to adopt one of these views into your systematic theology, or do you need more information on other aspects related to God’s goodness before making a decision?

(At this point I adopted the contemporary middle ground to my system.)
