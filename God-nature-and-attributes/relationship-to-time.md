# God’s Relationship to Time

This document focuses on God’s relation to time. It is one component of the broader God-nature-and-attributes mini-locus. For an overview of how this fits with other attributes, see `God-nature-and-attributes.md` in this folder.

For a fuller survey of time models, key thinkers, adapted Kalam arguments, and physics-related reflections, see the companion notes file: `relationship-to-time-notes.md`.

## Adopted Position (Provisional)

**Working Model: Polkinghorne-Style Block Universe (Eternalism) with Meta-Time**

> God created a space-time "block" in which all moments of created time—past, present, and future—are equally real. God Himself exists in **meta-time**, from which He views and sustains the entire temporal order, while also acting within cosmic time in genuinely sequential, relational ways.

Key features:

- **Block Universe / Eternalism (for created time)**  
  All moments of created time are equally real in the space-time structure God has made. What we call the “flow” of time is a feature of creaturely experience within this structure, not an objective edge where reality grows.

- **Meta-Time**  
  God is not simply timeless in a strict Boethian sense nor confined within cosmic time. Instead:
  - God exists in a higher-order **meta-time** from which He knows and sustains the entire block.  
  - God can and does act **within** cosmic time, entering into sequences of interaction with creatures.

- **Relation to Omniscience**  
  God’s omniscience includes the whole of created time "at once" in meta-time, while God’s actions are relationally ordered in cosmic time. This dovetails with your Molinist view of middle knowledge.

- **Relation to Kalam**  
  You adapt the **Kalam Cosmological Argument** as follows:
  - God exists in meta-time "before" the universe.  
  - By creating, God brings cosmic time into being as a finite block.  
  - God remains transcendent as Creator of the block, while also immanently involved in sustaining and acting within it (see notes for the step-by-step adapted Kalam).

This model is held **tentatively** and is open to revision as you study alternative accounts of divine eternity and temporality.

## Brief Comparative Notes (See Notes File for Full Survey)

In outline, your adopted model stands between:

- **Classical Boethian Timelessness**  
  - God entirely outside time, seeing all events "in a single glance," with no succession in God.  
  - You appropriate the emphasis on divine transcendence and at-once knowledge, but modify the picture to allow **meta-temporal succession** so that God is not a “frozen” observer.

- **Presentism / A-Theory (e.g., William Lane Craig)**  
  - Only the present is real; God exists in real, flowing time and has temporal foreknowledge of future contingents.  
  - You appreciate the emphasis on relationality and dynamic interaction, but judge that the block-universe-with-meta-time model better fits both physics and your broader metaphysical commitments, while still allowing real divine responsiveness.

A more detailed comparison table between Eternalism/Polkinghorne and Presentism/Craig (along with Boethian models) is preserved in `relationship-to-time-notes.md`.

## Physics Snapshot (Very High-Level)

Your working stance (held provisionally) is that:

- Relativistic physics (SR/GR and QFT) is **naturally formulated** in terms of a 4D spacetime, which sits comfortably with a block-style ontology of time.
- These theories **do not prove** eternalism: the claim that all times are equally real is a metaphysical interpretation, not a theorem of physics.
- Physics **underdetermines** the metaphysics of time, but the block universe is a simple, direct reading of relativistic spacetime, whereas presentist or growing-block views require additional metaphysical structure.

The notes file holds the more detailed articulation of this stance.

## Open Questions / Deferred Issues

You currently treat the following as in-progress questions (see also `God-nature-and-attributes-notes.md` and `relationship-to-time-notes.md`):

- How does this block-universe-with-meta-time model compare to:
  - **A-theory vs B-theory** of time more broadly?  
  - **Boethian timelessness** (God as timelessly eternal) and more traditional accounts of divine eternity?
- Can the block-universe-with-meta-time proposal be articulated **coherently and rigorously** in contemporary philosophy of time?  
- Does this model:
  - Preserve **genuine contingency** and creaturely freedom?  
  - Avoid collapsing divine knowledge into a form of **deterministic necessity**?  
  - Coheres with biblical depictions of God’s **dynamic interaction** in history (e.g., prayer, repentance, divine relenting)?

This file now carries a compact but substantive summary of your adopted view. Longer argumentation, comparisons, and reading notes are in `relationship-to-time-notes.md` and should be kept in sync with this doctrinal statement as your thinking develops.
