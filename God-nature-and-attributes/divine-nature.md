# Divine Nature (Aseity, Simplicity, Maximal Greatness)

This document focuses on God’s **nature** understood in terms of aseity, simplicity (in a qualified sense), and maximal greatness. It is one component of the broader God-nature-and-attributes mini-locus. For a high-level overview and for other attributes, see `God-nature-and-attributes.md` in this folder.

## Adopted Position (Provisional)

**Working Definition**

> God is the necessary, uncaused, immaterial, personal, self-existent (aseity) Creator of all things, maximally great in power, knowledge, goodness, and being. God’s perfections are not independent “parts” of God but different conceptual angles on the one, simple divine life.

Key features:

- **Aseity**  
  God exists in and of Himself and depends on nothing outside Himself. All finite reality depends on God for its existence at every moment.

- **Qualified Simplicity**  
  You affirm that God is not composed of parts, yet you allow for:
  - Conceptual distinctions among attributes (power, knowledge, goodness, etc.).
  - Distinct **relational expressions** of these perfections in history (e.g., how power, knowledge, and love are manifested in different biblical events).

- **Maximal Greatness**  
  God possesses all great-making properties (such as power, knowledge, and goodness) to the highest coherent degree. God is not one being among others but the self-existent ground of all being and goodness.

This position is **provisional** and may be refined as your understanding of classical and contemporary accounts of aseity and simplicity matures.

## Open Questions / Deferred Issues

You consider the following issues explicitly in progress (see also `God-nature-and-attributes-notes.md` for a fuller study agenda):

- How to articulate a **qualified simplicity** that:
  - Avoids modal collapse.
  - Honors classical insights (especially patristic and medieval formulations).
  - Preserves genuine contingency in creation.
- How to relate **simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** to:
  - The incarnation and the suffering of Christ.
  - God’s real relational responsiveness to creaturely history.
- How to give a richer biblical and historical account of **aseity**, beyond assuming it as a background commitment.

This file is intentionally light on argument; the main goal at this stage is to state your current working position clearly. Further argumentation and detailed notes can go in `divine-nature-notes.md` and in the general `God-nature-and-attributes-notes.md`.
