## Adopted Position (Provisional)

**Working Definition: Punctiliar Presence**

> God is fully and personally present at every point in space-time. God’s presence is not a diffused substance nor a mere metaphor, but an actual, immediate, personal presence at each location and moment, though not always manifest.

Key features:

- **Full Personal Presence**  
  At every point of space-time, God is wholly present, not partially or by division.

- **Not Spread-Out Substance**  
  You reject the idea that God is extended like a physical substance. Omnipresence is a mode of personal presence, not spatial extension.

- **Compatibility with Time Model**  
  This view fits your block-universe-with-meta-time account:
  - God is punctually present at each point within the created block.
  - God also stands in meta-time, relating to the entire temporal order.

- **Relational Emphasis**  
  Omnipresence highlights God’s **intimacy** with creation and supports a robust account of God’s presence in prayer, worship, suffering, and joy.

This position is held **provisionally**, recognizing that the metaphysics of presence and location in relation to a non-spatial God remains philosophically complex.

## Open Questions / Deferred Issues

You treat the following concerns as in progress (see also `God-nature-and-attributes-notes.md` and `omnipresence-notes.md`):

- Does the Punctiliar Presence model risk **over-localizing** God, making Him seem confined to points in space-time?  
- How best to articulate God’s presence in relation to:
  - Classical claims about **immensity** and **ubiquity**.
  - The **incarnation** and sacramental presence.
- How this model interacts with biblical language of God’s presence in:
  - Heaven vs earth.
  - The temple, church, and indwelling of the Spirit.
