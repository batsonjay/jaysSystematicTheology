# Divine Omniscience

This document focuses on **divine omniscience**, with special attention to your adopted Molinist (middle-knowledge) view. It is one component of the broader God-nature-and-attributes mini-locus. For an overview and links to other attributes, see `God-nature-and-attributes.md` in this folder.

## Adopted Position (Provisional)

**Working Definition: Molinist Middle Knowledge**

> God knows all that can be known: all necessary truths, all possibilities, all contingent truths about the actual world, and all counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (what any free creature would freely do in any possible circumstance). On this basis, God freely chooses which world to actualize without causally determining free choices.

Key features:

- **Exhaustive Knowledge**  
  God knows:
  - All necessary truths and logically possible states of affairs.
  - All contingent truths about the actual world (past, present, future).
  - All **counterfactuals of creaturely freedom**.

- **Providence via Middle Knowledge**  
  God uses His knowledge of counterfactuals to:
  - Freely actualize a world (or range of worlds) in which His purposes are accomplished.  
  - Do so without causally determining free choices, preserving a robust sense of creaturely freedom.

- **Developmental Note**  
  You previously held an **Arminian simple-foreknowledge** view (God infallibly foreknows future free choices but does not employ counterfactuals in the same way). That prior view is now treated as part of your theological journey rather than your current position.

This Molinist account is your current working model and is held **provisionally**, subject to further work on its coherence and biblical grounding.

## Open Questions / Deferred Issues

You regard the following as significant open questions (see also `God-nature-and-attributes-notes.md` and `omniscience-notes.md`):

- The **grounding objection** to Molinism:
  - What grounds the truth of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom if those choices are genuinely free?
- The relation between:
  - Molinism and your use of **compatibilist** language under omnipotence.  
  - Molinism and different theories of **human freedom** (libertarian vs compatibilist accounts).
- Integration with other loci:
  - How middle knowledge shapes your doctrines of **predestination** and **election**.
  - How it interacts with the **problem of evil / evil and human freedom**.
  - How it informs **salvation** (e.g., sufficiency of opportunity, exclusivism vs inclusivism).

This file intentionally keeps the statement of your view concise. Further argumentation, comparisons, and reading notes should go in `omniscience-notes.md` and in the relevant loci (`predestination.md`, `problem-of-evil.md`, `salvation.md`).
