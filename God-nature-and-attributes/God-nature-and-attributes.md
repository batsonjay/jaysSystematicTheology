## I. Background and Biblical Foundations

**Working definition**: God is the **necessary, uncaused, immaterial, personal, self-existent (aseity)** Creator of all things, maximally great in **power, knowledge, goodness, and being**. God is not one being among others but the One in whom all finite existence depends.

Representative biblical themes (non-exhaustive):

- God as **Creator and Sustainer**: Gen 1–2; Ps 33; Acts 17:24–28; Col 1:16–17; Heb 1:3.
- God’s **holiness and uniqueness**: Exod 3:14; Deut 6:4; Isa 40–48.
- God’s **knowledge and presence**: Ps 139; Matt 10:29–31; Heb 4:13.
- God’s **power and kingship**: Ps 115:3; Dan 4:34–35; Eph 1:11.
- God’s **love and goodness**: Exod 34:6–7; Ps 136; John 3:16; Rom 5:8; 1 John 4:7–10.

You affirm a broadly **classical** view of God’s nature (aseity, maximal greatness, non-composite simplicity), but with some **contemporary adjustments** regarding God’s relation to time and the details of certain attributes.

---

## II. Survey of Major Views (Very High-Level, In Progress)

This section sketches some major families of views about God’s nature and attributes. It is intentionally brief and will be expanded as study continues.

### 1. Classical Theism (Timeless, Simple, Immutable, Impassible)

**Core Tenets**

- God is **absolutely simple** (no composition of parts, properties, or potentials).
- God is **timeless**, **immutable**, and **impassible** (not subject to change or passions).
- God’s knowledge, will, and power are identical with God’s essence.
- Strong emphasis on God’s **aseity, transcendence, and sovereignty**.

**Strengths**

- Safeguards divine **self-sufficiency** and non-dependence on creation.
- Offers a robust account of **divine perfection** and incorruptibility.
- Deep roots in **patristic and medieval** theology.

**Objections / Concerns (as you perceive them)**

- Risk of making God seem **distant** or **non-relational**, hard to reconcile with Scripture’s dynamic depictions.
- Difficult questions about how a strictly timeless, immutable God can genuinely **respond** to creaturely history.

---

### 2. Modified Classical / Analytic Theism

**Core Tenets**

- Retains core classical commitments (aseity, maximal greatness, moral perfection), but is more open to:
  - God’s being **everlasting through time** (rather than strictly timeless), or
  - Models where God stands in some relation to time (e.g., **meta-time** plus engagement with cosmic time).
- Often affirms a **qualified** form of simplicity and emphasizes God’s **relational** life with creatures.

**Strengths**

- Seeks to integrate classical insights with **biblical narratives** of God’s interaction in history.
- Offers space for more nuanced accounts of **providence, prayer, and suffering**.

**Objections / Concerns**

- Classical critics worry it compromises on divine **immutability** or **simplicity**.
- Requires more careful metaphysical work to avoid reintroducing problematic composition.

---

### 3. Open Theism / Process-Influenced Views (For Contrast)

**Core Tenets (very broadly)**

- God does not have **exhaustive definite foreknowledge** of future free choices (or the future is in some sense ontologically open).
- God is in genuine **give-and-take** with creation, learning or taking risks.
- Often emphasizes God’s **relational love** and responsiveness over sovereignty.

**Strengths**

- Takes seriously biblical language of **divine regret, change of mind, and contingency**.
- Pastoral appeal in highlighting God’s **shared suffering** with creation.

**Objections / Concerns (from your perspective)**

- Tension with strong biblical claims about God’s **knowledge** and **sovereign purpose**.
- Difficult to reconcile with a robust doctrine of **creation and providence**.

---

## III. Comparative Summary (Provisional)

- You find the **classical emphasis on aseity, maximal perfection, and moral goodness** compelling and non-negotiable.
- You are drawn to **modified classical / analytic** approaches that retain these commitments while allowing for:
  - A model of God’s relation to time that better accounts for **real history** and **relational responsiveness**.
  - More explicit integration with contemporary discussions of **free will, providence, and evil**.
- You currently **reject** open-theist or strongly process-influenced denials of exhaustive divine foreknowledge.

Your adopted positions therefore sit within the **modified classical** family, integrating:

- A **block-universe-with-meta-time** model of God and time.
- **Molinist middle knowledge**.
- **Punctiliar omnipresence**.
- A **contemporary adjustment** of omnipotence and omnibenevolence.

---

## IV. Evaluation and Arguments (Provisional)

Very briefly:

- You judge that a strong doctrine of God’s **aseity and maximal greatness** is necessary to secure:
  - God’s status as the **ground of being and goodness**.
  - A stable basis for **trust and worship**.
- At the same time, you find it important that God be **truly responsive** and engaged with creaturely history.
- You therefore:
  - Retain many classical affirmations (aseity, maximal perfection, moral goodness, non-composite simplicity in a qualified sense).
  - Modify the account of God’s **relation to time** and **mode of knowing** (through Molinism and the block-universe-with-meta-time model).

Detailed argumentation for each of these moves (e.g., for and against timelessness, for and against Molinism, etc.) is deferred to:

- `God-and-time.md` (for an entry point into God and time, now pointing to the per-attribute files).
- `predestination.md`, `problem-of-evil.md`, and `salvation.md` (for the interaction of attributes with providence, evil, and soteriology).

## V. Adopted Position(s)

This overview section lists your current working positions on key aspects of God’s nature and attributes at a high level. For fuller statements and notes, see the per-attribute files listed above.

- **Divine Nature (aseity, simplicity, maximal greatness)**  
  God is the necessary, uncaused, immaterial, personal, self-existent Creator of all things, maximally great in power, knowledge, goodness, and being. You affirm a **qualified simplicity** (no parts, but conceptual and relational distinctions among perfections).  
  → See `divine-nature.md` and `divine-nature-notes.md`.

- **God’s Relationship to Time**  
  You tentatively adopt a **Polkinghorne-style block universe (eternalism) with meta-time**: all created moments are equally real in a space-time block, while God exists in meta-time, knowing and sustaining the whole and acting within cosmic time.  
  → See `relationship-to-time.md` and `relationship-to-time-notes.md`.

- **Divine Omniscience**  
  You adopt a **Molinist middle-knowledge** view: God knows all necessary and contingent truths and all counterfactuals of creaturely freedom, and freely actualizes a world in light of that knowledge without causally determining free choices.  
  → See `omniscience.md` and `omniscience-notes.md`.

- **Divine Omnipresence**  
  You adopt a **Punctiliar Presence** view: God is fully and personally present at every point in space-time, not as a diffused substance but as an actual, immediate presence at each location and moment.  
  → See `omnipresence.md` and `omnipresence-notes.md`.

- **Divine Omnipotence**  
  You affirm a **contemporary compatibilist-style adjustment** of classical omnipotence: God can do all that is logically possible and consistent with His nature; He voluntarily expresses His power in ways that make room for genuine creaturely freedom, while retaining full capacity for miracles and special providence.  
  → See `omnipotence.md` and `omnipotence-notes.md`.

- **Divine Omnibenevolence**  
  You hold that **God’s unchanging character is the standard of moral goodness**. Goodness is objectively real, grounded neither in sheer divine fiat nor in a standard above God, but in who God eternally is: perfectly loving, just, faithful, and true.  
  → See `omnibenevolence.md` and `omnibenevolence-notes.md`.

- **God’s Love for Creation**  
  You adopt a **universally benevolent, redemptively particular** view: God wills the good and flourishing of all creatures, but in salvation His love is particularly efficacious toward those united to Christ by faith, understood within a Molinist framework.  
  → See `love-for-creation.md` and `love-for-creation-notes.md`.

- **God’s Purpose in Creating the Universe**  
  You affirm that God created the universe as a **generous outflow of His love**, seeking free and loving relationship with conscious beings and delighting in the flourishing of life, creativity, and diversity. Creation is not motivated by divine need or lack; God’s glory is understood as the radiant manifestation of His loving, wise, and good character.  
  → See `purpose-of-creation.md` and `purpose-of-creation-notes.md`.

All of these positions are explicitly **provisional**, held with openness to revision as biblical, historical, and philosophical study continues.

## VI. Implications and Pastoral Considerations (In Progress)

Some initial implications of this doctrine of God:

- **Trust and Worship**: Aseity and maximal greatness ground confidence that God is worthy of absolute trust and worship; God is not a large creature but the self-existent source of all.
- **Prayer and Providence**: The meta-time + cosmic time model undergirds both:
  - God’s sovereign ordering of history (through middle knowledge and providence).
  - The **real meaningfulness** of prayer, repentance, and obedience within time.
- **Comfort in Suffering**: Punctiliar presence and omnibenevolence together suggest that:
  - God is personally present in every moment of suffering.
  - God’s purposes include the ultimate **healing and flourishing** of creation, even when present circumstances are obscure.
- **Humility in Theological Disagreement**: The qualified nature of many of these positions should foster theological humility and openness to correction, especially where Scripture, tradition, and philosophical reflection bear complex witness.

This section is expected to grow as you integrate this locus more fully with pastoral and practical theology.

---

## VII. Objections and Responses (In Progress)

This section lists some major objections to your adopted positions and sketches only very initial directions for response.

- **Objection 1: Block-Universe-with-Meta-Time Weakens Divine Freedom or Makes Creation Necessary.**  
  *Concern*: If all of time is equally real in a block, it may seem that God could not have done otherwise, or that creation is fixed in a way that undermines God’s freedom.  
  **Provisional Response**: You treat the block as the result of God’s **free creative act**, not as a necessary structure that constrains Him. The modal questions (could God have created a different block, etc.) are handled via Molinist counterfactuals and remain open for more rigorous work.

- **Objection 2: Middle Knowledge Suffers from the Grounding Objection.**  
  *Concern*: What grounds the truth of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom if those choices are genuinely free?  
  **Provisional Response**: You regard the grounding objection as serious but not decisive. You tentatively hold that such truths can be grounded in God’s perfect understanding of creaturely essences and possibilities, while recognizing the need for deeper study.

- **Objection 3: Exclusivism Seems Hard to Reconcile with God’s Omnibenevolence.**  
  *Concern*: If salvation is through Christ alone and many never explicitly believe, how is God’s universal love and justice upheld?  
  **Provisional Response**: You lean on Molinism (God’s choice of a world in which all have sufficient opportunity to respond) and emphasize that the detailed shape of inclusivism/exclusivism remains under development in `salvation.md`. This locus simply affirms that God’s love and justice are not in ultimate conflict.

Additional objections (e.g., to punctiliar presence, to qualified simplicity, to compatibilist language about omnipotence) are anticipated and will be added as this doctrine matures.

## VIII. Open Questions and Deferred Issues

This section summarizes key areas where your doctrine of God’s nature and attributes is explicitly **in progress**. A fuller list and study agenda is maintained in `God-nature-and-attributes-notes.md` and in the per-attribute notes files.

1. **Divine Simplicity, Immutability, and Impassibility**  
   - How to articulate a **qualified** simplicity that avoids modal collapse while honoring classical insights.  
   - How to reconcile genuine relational responsiveness with a robust account of immutability and some form of impassibility.

2. **Time and Eternity**  
   - Comparative evaluation of **A-theory vs B-theory** of time.  
   - Assessment of **Boethian timelessness** vs. your meta-time + block-universe model.  
   - Whether the block-universe-with-meta-time account can be formulated coherently in contemporary philosophy of time.

3. **Omniscience and Middle Knowledge**  
   - Addressing the **grounding objection** more thoroughly.  
   - Clarifying the relation between Molinism and your language of **compatibilism** under omnipotence.  
   - Integrating this more tightly with `predestination.md`, `problem-of-evil.md`, and `salvation.md`.

4. **Omnipotence, Freedom, and Providence**  
   - Refining the language of **voluntary self-limitation** so that it does not suggest any deficiency in God.  
   - Exploring how your account handles particular cases of suffering, miracles, and unanswered prayer.

5. **Love, Goodness, and the Purpose of Creation**  
   - Clarifying how God’s essential goodness grounds **moral objectivity** and how it relates to divine wrath and judgment.  
   - Integrating your “generous outflow of love” account of creation with classical emphases on **God’s glory**.  
   - Working out your stance on **exclusivism/inclusivism/hopeful universalism** in light of Molinism and the broader soteriological loci.

For now, the positions stated above function as the **adopted view (provisional)** for this project, held with humility and openness to revision as biblical, historical, and philosophical study continues.
