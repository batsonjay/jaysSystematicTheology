## Adopted Position (Provisional)

**Working Definition: Creation as Generous Outflow of Divine Love**

> God created the universe as a generous outflow of His love, seeking free and loving relationship with conscious beings, and delighting in the flourishing of life, creativity, and diversity.

Key features:

- **No Divine Need or Lack**  
  Creation is not motivated by any deficiency in God. God, as self-existent and maximally perfect, does not need the world to be fulfilled.

- **Loving Relationship and Flourishing**  
  The primary purpose of creation is:
  - **Free and loving relationship** between God and creatures.  
  - The **flourishing** of life, creativity, and diversity within God’s good world.

- **Glory as Radiance of Love and Goodness**  
  You reject a picture in which God creates primarily as a bare display of sovereignty or glory abstracted from love. Instead:
  - God’s **glory** is understood as the radiant manifestation of His loving, wise, and good character in creation and redemption.
  - Thus, language of God creating "for His glory" is affirmed, but interpreted through this richer lens.

This position is held **provisionally**, open to further refinement as you integrate creation, providence, and eschatology.

## Open Questions / Deferred Issues

You treat the following as in-progress topics (see also `God-nature-and-attributes-notes.md`, `purpose-of-creation-notes.md`, and other loci such as `salvation.md` and `problem-of-evil.md`):

- How to relate this account of God’s loving purpose with:
  - Classical emphases on God’s **glory** and the **chief end** of creation.  
  - Concerns about **anthropocentrism** vs. the intrinsic value of non-human creation.
- How God’s purpose in creation connects with:
  - The **problem of evil** and the allowance of horrendous suffering.  
  - The ultimate **renewal of creation** (new heavens and new earth).

This file intentionally keeps the doctrinal statement concise. Further exploration, biblical studies, and engagement with historical theology should go in `purpose-of-creation-notes.md`.
