# God’s Love for Creation

This document focuses on **God’s love for creation**, including your current (provisional) stance on universal benevolence and redemptive particularity. It is one component of the broader God-nature-and-attributes mini-locus. For an overview and links to other attributes, see `God-nature-and-attributes.md` in this folder.

## Adopted Position (Provisional)

**Working Definition: Universally Benevolent, Redemptively Particular Love**

> God’s love is universally directed toward all creatures, willing their good and delighting in their flourishing. In relation to salvation, God’s redemptive love is particularly efficacious toward those who are united to Christ by faith, within a framework of Molinist providence.

Key features:

- **Universal Benevolence**  
  God freely wills the good of all creatures and delights in life, creativity, and diversity across creation.

- **Redemptive Particularity**  
  In matters of salvation:
  - You currently adopt an **Exclusivist** stance: salvation is through Christ alone.  
  - God’s love is real for all, but **redemptive love** is particularly efficacious toward those who respond in faith (with the detailed shape of inclusivist possibilities left open for `salvation.md`).

- **Temporal Relationality**  
  Within your time model (block universe with meta-time):
  - God’s love is experienced **within time** by creatures; His love is relational, dynamic, and responsive in the created temporal order.  
  - This temporal experience is grounded in God’s unchanging character in meta-time.

This position is held **provisionally**, with the expectation that it will be refined in dialogue with your loci on salvation, predestination, and the problem of evil.

## Open Questions / Deferred Issues

You treat the following as in-progress topics (see also `God-nature-and-attributes-notes.md`, `love-for-creation-notes.md`, `salvation.md`, and `predestination.md`):

- How exactly to articulate the relation between **universal benevolence** and **redemptive particularity**.  
- How your Exclusivist stance might interact with:
  - Possible **inclusivist** nuances (e.g., implicit faith, post-mortem opportunities).  
  - **Hopeful universalism**, if at all.  
- How to integrate God’s love for all with:
  - The reality of **judgment and hell**.  
  - Molinist claims about God’s choice of a world in which all have sufficient opportunity to respond.

This file intentionally keeps the doctrinal statement concise. Extended theological exploration, reading notes, and arguments should go in `love-for-creation-notes.md` and in the soteriological loci.
