# Doctrine of Divine Attributes

## Omniscience

- You affirm **God’s complete knowledge** of all things past, present, and future.
- Your model is shaped by:
  - **Molinism (Middle Knowledge)**: God knows all possible outcomes (counterfactuals of creaturely freedom) and actualizes a world in which free creatures act.
  - **Block Universe View** (Polkinghorne): God sees all of time as a completed whole, though He can act within it.

## Omnipresence

- You affirm **punctiliar presence**:
  - God is fully present at **each point** in space-time, rather than being spread across space.
  - His presence is active and relational in every location.

## Omnipotence

- You affirm a **contemporary adjustment** of classical omnipotence:
  - God can do all that is **logically possible** and **consistent with His nature**.
- You accept:
  - **Compatibilism**: Divine sovereignty and human free will are compatible.
  - **Interventionism**: God can and does act within the world without undermining its coherence.
  - **Intellectualism**: God acts according to reason and purpose, not arbitrary will.

## Omnibenevolence

- You affirm a **contemporary middle-ground**:
  - Morality is grounded in **God’s unchanging nature** (not arbitrary will).
  - Goodness is **objectively real** and expressed perfectly in divine action.
- God’s **love for creation** is understood as:
  - **Particular**: He enters into covenantal relationship with specific people and nations.
  - **Relational**: He is personally involved with His creation through time.

## Relationship to Time

- You reject both pure timelessness and full temporal embeddedness.
- You affirm:
  - God exists in **meta-time**, outside the created temporal sequence.
  - God interacts **within time**, but without being bound by it.
- You resonate with **Polkinghorne’s view** of time:
  - God is not constrained by time but is involved in temporal experience.
  - Time is a created reality within the block universe that God sees fully.
