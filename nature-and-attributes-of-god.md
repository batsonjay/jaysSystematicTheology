# Nature and Attributes of God

## God's Relationship to Time

You have adopted **John Polkinghorne’s Block Universe / Eternalism view**, in which:
- God exists **within time** (not timeless), yet views all of time as an extended present (block time).
- God is dynamically involved in temporal events and **experiences the unfolding of time**.
- You reconcile this with the Kalam Cosmological Argument by proposing that:
  - God existed in a **meta-time** state “before” creation, then entered into **cosmic time** upon creation.

## Omnipresence

You have adopted the **Punctiliar Presence View**:
- God is present at **every point in space-time**, not as a diffused essence but as fully present at each moment and place.
- This view preserves God's **intimacy** with creation and supports the **dynamic relational** view aligned with your time perspective.

---

## Omniscience

You hold a **contemporary adjustment of classical omniscience**:
- God knows all that **can** be known, including all actual and possible events.
- You adopt a **Molinist view** of God’s knowledge (middle knowledge): God knows what any creature **would freely do** in any given circumstance.

## Omnipotence

Your position includes several components:
1. **Contemporary adjustment of classical omnipotence** — God can do all that is **logically possible** and consistent with His nature.
2. **Compatibilism** — Divine power does not override human freedom but works in harmony with it.
3. **Interventionism** — God can intervene in creation (e.g., miracles).
4. **Intellectualism** — God's power is governed by His wisdom and moral nature.

## Omnibenevolence

You have adopted a **contemporary middle-ground view**:
- God’s goodness is not defined by external moral standards (Euthyphro dilemma), nor by arbitrary divine fiat.
- Instead, **goodness is defined by God’s essential nature**—loving, just, and faithful.
- This view grounds moral coherence and avoids divine capriciousness.

## God’s Love for Creation

You have adopted the **Exclusivist view** of God’s love, aligned with your Molinist theology:
- God’s love is real for all, but **redemptive love** is particularly efficacious toward those who respond in faith.
- You lean toward a **Polkinghorne-style temporal relationship**, in which God's love is experienced **within** time and creation, not just beyond it.

_(Note: A prior flag to revisit this based on predestination was removed after switching to Molinism.)_

## God's Purpose in Creating the Universe

You adopted the view that:
> “God created the universe as a generous outflow of His love, seeking free and loving relationship with conscious beings, and delighting in the flourishing of life, creativity, and diversity.”

- This affirms that creation is not about divine need or coercion, but about **loving relationship** and **purposeful flourishing**.
- You **reject glory-seeking or sovereign-display motivations** as primary drivers.
