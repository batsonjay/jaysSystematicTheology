# The Problem of Evil

_This locus explores the challenge that evil and suffering pose to belief in the all-good, all-powerful, and all-knowing God of Christian theism, and how this relates to human freedom, sin, and salvation._

At the center of this project’s approach is the conviction that:

- Evil is **real** and objectively wrong, measured against the goodness of God.
- Human beings possess **genuine (libertarian) freedom**, such that their choices are morally meaningful.
- God is **not the author of evil**, even though he sovereignly permits and ultimately overcomes it.

These convictions are provisionally developed here and connected to other loci (especially salvation, predestination, anthropology, and God and time).

## I. Background and Biblical Foundations (In Progress)

### 1. What Is “Evil”?

It is helpful to distinguish several overlapping categories:

- **Moral evil**: Evil resulting from the choices of moral agents (e.g., murder, betrayal, oppression).  
- **Natural evil**: Suffering caused by impersonal natural forces or structures (e.g., earthquakes, disease, famine).  
- **Existential/experiential evil**: Deep, personal experiences of alienation, anguish, despair, and apparent meaninglessness.

In Scripture, evil is opposed to God’s character and purposes. It appears both as **rebellion** (sin) and as **suffering** (the groaning of creation). Key biblical themes include:

- God’s goodness and holiness (e.g., Ps 25; Jas 1:13–17).  
- Human sin and rebellion (Gen 3; Rom 1–3).  
- Creation’s groaning and bondage to decay (Rom 8:18–25).  
- God’s redemptive response to evil in Christ’s suffering, death, and resurrection (Isa 53; Mk 15; Rom 5; Rev 21–22).

A full biblical theology of evil is **deferred** for later, once other loci (especially salvation and anthropology) are more mature.

### 2. The Problem Stated

The classical formulation of the problem of evil can be summarized like this:

1. God is all-powerful.  
2. God is all-knowing.  
3. God is perfectly good.  
4. Evil exists.

How can these four claims be held together without contradiction or severe tension?

Different versions press this tension in different ways:

- The **logical problem** claims that the very existence of evil is incompatible with theism.  
- The **evidential/probabilistic problem** concedes logical compatibility but argues that the *amount, kind, and distribution* of evil make God’s existence highly improbable.  
- The **pastoral/experiential problem** focuses less on argument and more on the lived weight of suffering, trauma, and unanswered prayer.

## II. Survey of Major Views

### 1. Classic Formulations of the Problem

- **Logical Problem of Evil**  
  Can an all-powerful, all-good God coexist with evil at all?  
  Famously associated with Epicurus and, in modern analytic form, with J. L. Mackie. The logical problem has largely been answered in contemporary philosophy of religion, especially through free-will style defenses.

- **Evidential / Probabilistic Problem of Evil**  
  Even if it is *logically possible* that God and evil coexist, is it *likely* that a God of perfect goodness would allow **this much** evil, of **these horrific kinds**, with **this pattern of apparently pointless suffering**?  
  Often associated with William Rowe and others.

- **Pastoral / Existential Problem of Evil**  
  How can believers respond to the felt horror of suffering—grief, injustice, trauma—without collapsing into despair or offering shallow answers? This is less a formal argument and more a question about **trust, lament, and hope**.

### 2. Major Theodicies and Defenses

Here are some of the major strategies Christian thinkers have used to respond to the problem of evil:

| Theodicy / Defense       | Core Idea                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Free Will Defense**    | Evil is the price of granting created agents significant freedom (often framed in terms of possible worlds and God’s middle knowledge; associated with Alvin Plantinga). |
| **Soul-Making Theodicy** | Suffering functions as a context for growth in virtue, Christlikeness, and mature love (John Hick and others). |
| **Greater-Good Theodicy**| God permits particular evils because they are ordered toward goods that could not (or would not) be obtained otherwise, many of which may be inscrutable to us. |
| **Warfare Theodicy**     | A significant portion of evil is explained by spiritual conflict between created good and evil powers (angelic/demonic), within the bounds of God’s ultimate sovereignty. |
| **Redemptive Suffering** | God enters into human suffering in Christ; the cross and resurrection reveal that God defeats evil not merely by prevention but by bearing and transforming it. |

These are not mutually exclusive; many contemporary approaches combine elements of several.

## III. Comparative Summary (Provisional)

Very briefly:

- **Free will** approaches highlight the value of significant creaturely freedom for love and moral responsibility, but can struggle with natural evil and "gratuitous" suffering.  
- **Soul-making** emphasizes the formative role of hardship but risks sounding like it justifies or sanitizes horrific evils if not carefully nuanced.  
- **Greater-good** theodicies insist that God’s wisdom may be beyond our grasp, but can risk fatalism or sounding like every particular evil is somehow good-in-disguise.  
- **Warfare** accounts helpfully foreground the reality of spiritual opposition but can obscure the relation between God’s sovereignty and created powers.  
- **Redemptive suffering** centers the cross and resurrection, insisting that God’s answer to evil is at least as much **participation and victory** as it is **explanation**.

In this project, the likely long-term direction is some kind of **integrated approach**: a free-will defense within a providential/Molinist framework, enriched by soul-making and eschatological hope, and framed christologically by God’s self-giving in the cross.

## IV. Evaluation and Arguments (Provisional)

This section is intentionally provisional and will be revisited once work on salvation, predestination, anthropology, and God and time is more developed.

Current evaluative commitments include:

- **Moral realism**: Good and evil are real and are ultimately grounded in the character of God. Evil is not an illusion or simply a label for what we dislike.  
- **Libertarian human freedom**: Human beings possess genuine alternative possibilities in at least some of their choices. This freedom is essential for love, moral responsibility, and the meaningfulness of sin and repentance.  
- **Divine permission, not authorship**: God does not cause or author evil in a way that collapses creaturely responsibility, even though he foreknows and sovereignly permits what free creatures do.  
- **Compatibility with meticulous providence (Molinism)**: A Molinist-style account of God’s middle knowledge and providence appears promising for holding together divine sovereignty, infallible foreknowledge, and libertarian freedom.

I reject, at least provisionally:

- **Hard determinism** that renders human choices ultimately non-responsible and reduces evil to the outworking of a deterministic decree.  
- **Open theism** that denies exhaustive divine foreknowledge in order to protect creaturely freedom.  
- **Any view that makes God morally culpable for evil**, as if God were the direct author of sin or indifferent to suffering.

The precise argumentative structure for these commitments is still under development and will draw heavily on the doctrines of God, creation, providence, and salvation.

## V. Adopted Position(s) (Working)

**Working Definition (Subject to Refinement):**

> Evil is the privation and distortion of the good that God wills for his creation, manifest in both sinful choices and in the suffering and corruption of a fallen world. God, who is perfectly good, powerful, and wise, has created a world in which rational creatures possess significant freedom. In such a world, God permits evil—without authoring it—as part of a providential plan ordered toward the ultimate defeat of evil, the redemption of creation in Christ, and the fuller realization of loving communion with God.

Key features of this working view:

- **Libertarian freedom**: Created agents (human, and perhaps angelic) are able to choose between genuine alternatives; this is crucial for love, obedience, and moral accountability.  
- **Molinist providence** (tentative): God’s middle knowledge of what free creatures would do in any possible circumstance informs his providential decision about which world to actualize, allowing for meticulous sovereignty without collapsing freedom.  
- **Permission, not causation**: God’s relation to evil is one of **permission** and **overruling wisdom**, not direct causation of sinful acts.  
- **Christocentric resolution**: The ultimate answer to evil is not merely an abstract explanation but the person and work of Christ—his suffering with and for us, his resurrection, and the promised restoration of all things.  
- **Eschatological vindication**: Many evils, especially horrific and apparently pointless ones, may only be seen as defeated and “answered” in the eschaton (new creation, final judgment, wiping away of tears).

This is an **adopted but provisional** stance. Its coherence and biblical grounding will need to be tested and refined as other loci are developed.

---

## VI. Implications and Pastoral Considerations (In Progress)

Some early pastoral and practical implications:

- **Legitimacy of lament**: A robust doctrine of evil must make room for deep lament and protest (e.g., the Psalms, Lamentations, Job), not just abstract theodicies.  
- **Solidarity of God with sufferers**: Christ’s incarnation and passion mean that God’s response to evil includes **entering into** suffering, not merely explaining it from a distance.  
- **Hope of justice and restoration**: Final judgment and new creation matter for answering evil; many evils will only be addressed eschatologically.  
- **Pastoral caution about “explaining” evil**: Even if some explanatory framework is true, it can be pastorally harmful if delivered glibly in the face of fresh trauma. The mode of response (weeping, silence, presence) is as important as the content.

This section should expand over time with more specific pastoral applications.

---

## VII. Objections and Responses (In Progress)

This section will eventually gather structured objections to the adopted view and provisional responses. For now, a few key concerns are simply flagged:

- **Natural evil**: Even if moral evil can be linked to creaturely freedom, why does God permit so much suffering from disease, disasters, and apparently built-in features of the created order?  
  - *Provisional note*: Soul-making, cosmic fall narratives, and eschatological resolution are all candidates here, but this needs careful work.

- **Gratuitous suffering**: Are there evils that appear to have no justifying reason whatsoever? If so, how can this be squared with meticulous providence and Molinism without making God morally suspect?  

- **Hiddenness of God in suffering**: Why does God so often seem absent or silent precisely when people suffer most?

Responses to these objections are **deferred** until related loci (God’s attributes, providence, Christology, eschatology) are fuller.

---

## VIII. Open Questions and Deferred Issues

Several important threads are explicitly left open for future work. Many of these are currently explored (or will be) in `problem-of-evil-notes.md` and in other loci.

- **Problem of natural evil**: How to integrate disease, disasters, and evolutionary history into a theologically coherent picture of creation and fall.  
- **Evolutionary creation and moral agency**: How an evolutionary account of human origins interacts with the rise of moral responsibility, sin, and culpability.  
- **Metaphysical grounding of libertarian freedom under Molinism**: How exactly libertarian freedom and God’s middle knowledge fit together without collapsing either divine sovereignty or creaturely freedom.  
- **The role of spiritual warfare**: To what extent should a warfare theodicy be foregrounded in explaining particular evils, and how does this relate to divine sovereignty?  
- **Integration with other loci**:  
  - With **predestination** and **salvation**: how election, calling, and grace relate to human freedom and responsibility in a world saturated with evil (see `predestination.md`, `salvation.md`).  
  - With the **doctrine of God** and **God and time**: how God’s eternity, knowledge, and relation to temporal events bear on his permission and orchestration of evil (see `God-and-time.md` and the divine attributes files).  
  - With **anthropology**: how human nature, fallenness, and the imago Dei condition both our capacity for evil and our hope for redemption (see `anthropology.md` / `human-nature.md`).

For now, the working stance of this project is that evil is **real and horrific**, yet **neither ultimate nor victorious**. It is permitted within a world of significant creaturely freedom that God, in Christ, is determined to redeem and renew, even where the precise reasons for particular evils remain hidden.
