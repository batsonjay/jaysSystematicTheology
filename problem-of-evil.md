# The Problem of Evil and Human Choice

## Overview

The Problem of Evil poses one of the most enduring and difficult challenges to theistic belief, especially belief in an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good God. This section sets the stage for theological engagement with human nature, sin, and salvation.

## Categories of Evil

- **Moral Evil**: Evil resulting from the choices of moral agents (e.g., murder, betrayal).
- **Natural Evil**: Suffering caused by impersonal natural forces (e.g., earthquakes, disease).
- **Existential Evil**: Deep, personal experiences of alienation, suffering, or despair.

## Classic Formulations

- **Logical Problem of Evil**:  
  Can an all-powerful, all-good God coexist with evil?  
  Famously articulated by Epicurus and restated in modern times by J.L. Mackie.

- **Evidential Problem of Evil**:  
  Does the extent or severity of evil make God's existence unlikely?  
  Defended by William Rowe and others.

- **Pastoral/Experiential Problem of Evil**:  
  Concerned with emotional and spiritual responses to suffering more than rational arguments.

## Major Theodicies

| Theodicy Name           | Core Idea                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Free Will Defense       | Evil is the price of granting humans free will (Alvin Plantinga).        |
| Soul-Making Theodicy    | Suffering refines virtue and character (John Hick).                      |
| Greater Good Theodicy   | God permits evil for a higher purpose, often inscrutable to humans.      |
| Warfare Theodicy        | Spiritual warfare between good and evil agents explains suffering.       |
| Redemptive Suffering    | Christ's suffering reveals God's solidarity with human pain.             |

## Your Systematic Theology

You’ve expressed that full treatment of evil will come after other foundations are laid. For now:

- ❗ *Placeholder entry*: You plan to address theodicy in depth when developing your views on salvation and human anthropology.
- You are currently working from a **Molinist** framework, which anticipates incorporating a **Free Will Defense** grounded in God’s middle knowledge.
- You have affirmed the **existence of genuine human choice** as compatible with divine foreknowledge.

## Future Work

You’ve requested a future deep dive into:

- The compatibility of evolutionary creationism with moral responsibility
- The metaphysical grounding of free will under Molinism
- The role of natural evil in a fine-tuned universe
