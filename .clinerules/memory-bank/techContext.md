# Tech Context – Jay’s Systematic Theology

This repository is a **markdown-only writing project**, not an executable software system.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Format:** Plain Markdown files (`.md`).
- **Version control:** Git (and likely GitHub) for history and collaboration.
- **Editing environment:** Typically a text editor or IDE such as Visual Studio Code.
- **Assistant tooling:** Cline + `.clinerules/memory-bank` for project-aware assistance.

There is **no build system, runtime, or deployment pipeline** associated with this repo. All value is in the content and its organization.

## Constraints and Conventions

- Keep the repo simple: no unnecessary code scaffolding or tooling.
- Prefer **one topic (or closely related cluster) per markdown file**.
- Use relative links between documents (e.g., from outline to topic files) to keep navigation easy.

## How Cline Should Use This File

- Remember that suggestions should focus on **structure, clarity, and theological method**, not on software architecture.
- When recommending changes, prioritize:
  - Clear file naming and topic boundaries.
  - Consistent internal structure across doctrine files.
  - Helpful cross-linking between related topics.
