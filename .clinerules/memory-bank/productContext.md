# Product Context – Jay’s Systematic Theology

This project is a **personal systematic theology** in markdown form. It is not an app or a library; all value is in the ideas and how they are organized.

For full product intent, see the root file: [`../../README.md`](../../README.md).

## Primary Purposes

Summarizing the root product context, this project serves three main purposes:

1. **Personal Learning and Discernment**  
   A structured place to track ongoing theological study, allowing views to be compared, refined, adopted, or deferred over time.

2. **Defense of the Faith**  
   To articulate Christian belief in a way that is coherent, intellectually serious, and accessible to sincere skeptics or non-Christians.

3. **Support for Struggling Believers**  
   To provide a theological framework that can help Christians wrestling with doubt or deconstruction reconstruct a resilient confidence in Christ.

## Audience and Tone

- **Primary audience:** the author, future self, and close conversation partners (questioning friends, struggling believers).  
- **Secondary audience:** any thoughtful reader interested in Christian doctrine.
- **Tone:** careful, charitable, historically informed, and open-handed where the tradition legitimately disagrees.

## How Cline Should Use This File

- Treat this as a **high-level reminder of why the project exists**.  
- When proposing structural changes or new documents, ask: *Does this serve learning, defense, and support for believers?*
- Keep the **primary context** in the root `README.md`; avoid duplicating too much detail here to reduce drift.
