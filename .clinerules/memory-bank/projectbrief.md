# Project Brief – Jay’s Systematic Theology (Memory Bank)

## Purpose of This Project

This repository is a **writing and research project**, not a software application. Its purpose is to support the construction of a **systematic theology** by providing a structured, evolving set of markdown documents.

Authoritative source documents in the repo:
- Project overview and product context: [`README.md`](../../README.md)
- High-level outline: [`high-level-outline.md`](../../high-level-outline.md) *(when present / updated)*

## Core Method

The methodology of this theology project (summarizing the overview and method described in `README.md`):

- Each doctrinal topic is explored by **surveying multiple views** – historical, philosophical, and doctrinal.
- When a particular view is found persuasive, it is **explicitly adopted** into the developing system.
- Views may be **deferred for future study** and clearly marked as such.
- The entire project is treated as **open-ended and maturing over time**, emphasizing humility and willingness to revise.
- The goal is not novelty for its own sake, but **deep engagement with Christian tradition** combined with personal ownership of conclusions.

## Scope and Structure

This project aims to cover standard loci of Christian systematic theology, including but not limited to:

- Existence of God / arguments for God
- Revelation
- Doctrine of God (theology proper)
  - Divine attributes
  - Trinity
- Christology
- Creation
- Humanity (anthropology)
- Sin
- Problem of evil
- Salvation (soteriology)
- The Holy Spirit (pneumatology)
- The Church (ecclesiology)
- Last things (eschatology)

Each topic is or will be represented by one or more **markdown documents**, often one file per doctrinal locus or subtopic.

## How Cline Should Use This Brief

- Treat this file as the **memory-bank summary** of the project’s intent and outline.
- For **authoritative theological content or structure**, always consult the root files in the repo:
- [`../../README.md`](../../README.md)
- And any outline files such as [`../../high-level-outline.md`](../../high-level-outline.md) when present.
- Use this memory-bank brief to stay aligned with:
  - The project’s **non-software nature**
  - The **method** (survey, adopt, or defer views)
  - The **goal** of a coherent, personally owned systematic theology.
