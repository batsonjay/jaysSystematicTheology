# Progress – Jay’s Systematic Theology

## Current Status Summary

- Core project intent and method are defined in the root [`README.md`](../../README.md).
- A high-level doctrinal outline exists in [`high-level-outline.md`](../../high-level-outline.md).
- Several locus-level documents are present as **works in progress**, including (non-exhaustive):
  - `existence-of-god.md` / `arguments-for-god.md`
  - `problem-of-evil.md` / `evil-and-human-freedom.md`
  - `divine-nature-and-attributes.md` / `nature-and-attributes-of-god.md`
  - `doctrine-of-the-trinity.md`
  - `God-and-time.md`
  - `salvation.md`
  - `predestination.md`
  - `anthropology.md` / `human-nature.md`
  - `christology.md`

## What’s Working

- The **survey → evaluate → adopt/defer** method is articulated at the project level.
- The file layout broadly mirrors classic loci of systematic theology.
- The project is clearly oriented toward:
  - Personal learning and discernment.
  - Defense of the faith for sincere skeptics.
  - Support for struggling believers.

## Known Gaps / To-Do (High Level)

These are not action items for a single session, but broad areas for ongoing development:

- Fill out underdeveloped or placeholder sections across locus files.
- Normalize structure so that most doctrine files share a common spine:
  - Background / biblical foundations
  - Survey of major views
  - Evaluation and arguments
  - Adopted position(s)
  - Objections and responses
  - Open questions / deferred issues
- Strengthen cross-references between related topics (e.g., predestination ↔ salvation ↔ problem of evil ↔ God and time).
- Make adopted positions and open questions more explicit using headings or labels.

## This Session’s Contribution

- Initialized repo-local Cline memory bank under `.clinerules/memory-bank` with:
  - `projectbrief.md`
  - `productContext.md`
  - `systemPatterns.md`
  - `techContext.md`
  - `activeContext.md`
  - `progress.md`
- Captured:
  - That the project is a **non-software, markdown-only** theology effort.
  - The methodological emphasis on surveying views, then adopting or deferring them.
  - Near-term structural priorities for future writing work.
