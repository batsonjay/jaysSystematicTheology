# Active Context – Jay’s Systematic Theology

_Last updated: initialization of repo-local memory bank._

## Current Focus

- Establishing a **Cline memory bank** for this repository under `.clinerules/memory-bank`.
- Ensuring the memory bank:
  - Mirrors the intent of the root `README.md`.
  - Emphasizes that this is a **writing / theology** project, not an application.
  - Captures key patterns: survey views → evaluate → adopt or defer.

## Current Writing Posture

- Treat existing doctrine files (`existence-of-god.md`, `salvation.md`, `predestination.md`, `God-and-time.md`, etc.) as **works in progress**.
- Prioritize:
  - Clear sectioning and labels (e.g., adopted positions, open questions).
  - Charity toward differing views.
  - Explicit connections to the high-level outline in `high-level-outline.md`.

## Near-Term Next Steps

When returning to this project, likely next useful moves include:

1. **Normalize structure** across key doctrine files (headings like: background, survey of views, adopted position, objections/open questions), following the **Doctrine File Normalization Pattern** in `systemPatterns.md` and the template in `doctrine-normalization-template.md`.
2. **Cross-link topics** where doctrinally relevant (e.g., `predestination.md` with `salvation.md`, `problem-of-evil.md`, and `God-and-time.md`).
3. **Clarify adopted positions vs. open questions** in each locus, using explicit labels.

For overall intent and scope, always re-check:
- [`README.md`](../../README.md)
- [`high-level-outline.md`](../../high-level-outline.md)
