# Doctrine File Normalization Template

This template captures the standard **normalized structure** for locus-level doctrine files in *Jay’s Systematic Theology*.

It implements the pattern described in [`systemPatterns.md`](./systemPatterns.md) under “Doctrine File Normalization Pattern.”

> **Usage:**
> - Copy this skeleton into a new doctrine file, or
> - Use it as a guide when **normalizing** an existing, more ad hoc document.
> - Preserve all substantive content; relocate and annotate rather than delete.

# [Doctrine Title]

_A one-paragraph overview of what this doctrine is about and how it fits within the wider system. Optionally note connections to other loci (e.g., predestination ↔ salvation ↔ problem of evil ↔ God and time)._  

Example:
> This document explores ... and concludes (for now) with the adopted position of this system: **[Adopted View Name]**, held with openness to revision.

---

## I. Background and Biblical Foundations

- Briefly define the doctrine in your own words.
- List key biblical themes and representative passages (not exhaustive exegesis).
- Note how this locus connects to others (e.g., salvation, problem of evil, divine attributes).
- Clarify that the current aim is conceptual mapping rather than final, detailed exegesis.

---

## II. Survey of Major Views

_Sketch the main live options in the tradition and contemporary theology. Aim for charity and clarity._

### 1. [View / Tradition Name]

**Core Tenets**:
- Bullet key claims.

**Strengths**:
- Bullet perceived strengths.

**Objections** (as I see them):
- Bullet your main concerns or questions.

---

### 2. [View / Tradition Name]

(Repeat the above pattern for each major view.)

---

## III. Comparative Summary (Optional but Recommended)

_Summarize contrasts between views in a small table or concise bullets._

- Highlight differences in: view of God, view of humanity, account of evil, relation to other doctrines, etc.
- This is a place for high-level synthesis, not detailed argument.

---

## IV. Evaluation and Arguments (Provisional)

_Here you shift from survey to evaluation._

- State which features of the surveyed views you find most and least persuasive, and why.
- Tie your evaluation to:
  - Scripture
  - The broader Christian tradition
  - Philosophical/theological coherence
- Make it explicit that this section is **provisional** and subject to revision as study continues.

---

## V. Adopted Position(s)

_Clearly mark your current adopted view, even if held tentatively._

**Working Definition** (subject to refinement):

> [One-paragraph or multi-sentence statement of the doctrine as you currently affirm it.]

Key features:
- Bullet the core commitments.
- Note how this view relates to key themes in other loci (e.g., salvation, problem of evil, divine attributes, anthropology).

You may optionally use a label like **Adopted View (Provisional)** to signal openness to change.

---

## VI. Implications and Pastoral Considerations (Optional but Encouraged)

_Explore how this doctrine functions in Christian life and ministry._

Consider:
- How does this doctrine shape the way we preach, pray, suffer, and hope?
- What pastoral dangers arise from distorting this doctrine in various directions?
- How might this doctrine comfort or challenge struggling believers?

---

## VII. Objections and Responses (In Progress)

_List key objections to your adopted position and begin sketching responses._

- **Objection 1:** [State the concern charitably].  
  **Provisional Response:** [Your current best reply; can be very short at first].

- **Objection 2:** ...

Make it clear this section is **in progress** and expected to grow as you read more.

---

## VIII. Open Questions and Deferred Issues

_Explicitly list unresolved questions and areas you are deferring for future work._

Examples:
- Passages that need deeper exegetical study.
- Philosophical puzzles that remain unclear.
- How this doctrine interacts with other loci that are themselves still in flux.
- Alternative models you still want to explore.

End with a brief note such as:

> For now, **[Adopted View Name]** is the adopted view in this project, held with a posture of humility and openness to revision as study continues.
