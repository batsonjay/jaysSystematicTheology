# Introduction

This systematic theology is being constructed with three key purposes in mind:

1. **Personal Learning and Discernment**  
   To create a well-structured, comprehensive place to track ongoing theological study. As new insights and perspectives are discovered, this system may evolve, reflecting a personal journey of exploration and understanding.

2. **Defense of the Faith**  
   To provide a coherent and compelling articulation of Christian belief. The goal is to demonstrate to skeptical or non-Christian friends that this theology is not based on fairy tales, but on reasoned, informed thought. It should invite sincere seekers to engage more deeply with the Christian way.

3. **Support for Struggling Believers**  
   To offer a theological framework that can aid Christians experiencing doubt or difficulty. This system seeks to affirm the intellectual and spiritual integrity of the faith, helping others reconstruct a confident and resilient belief in Christ.

### Method

- Each theological topic is considered by surveying multiple views—historical, philosophical, and doctrinal.
- When a particular view is found persuasive, it is **explicitly adopted** and added to the system.
- Some views are deferred for future study and marked accordingly.
- This theology assumes a posture of humility and openness, recognizing that it is a work in progress, meant to mature alongside the theologian.

**Note:** This system does not aim to innovate for novelty’s sake, but to deeply engage the tradition while personally owning its conclusions.
