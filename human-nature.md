# Human Nature

## Created in the Image of God

You affirm that:
- Humans are created **in the image of God** (*imago Dei*), which entails:
  - Relational capacity with God and others.
  - Moral awareness and responsibility.
  - Rationality, creativity, and the ability to love.
- This image is **not lost** after the Fall but is **marred**, requiring redemption.

## Human Constitution

You remain open on the exact structure of human nature (body-soul, body-soul-spirit, etc.), but presently lean toward a **dualist** view:
- Humans consist of a material body and an immaterial soul.
- The soul is the seat of personhood and continues after death.

## Evolutionary Creationism

You affirm **evolutionary creationism**:
- God used evolutionary processes to bring about biological life, including humans.
- You do **not** read Genesis as a literal scientific account but as a **theological narrative** of God's calling of a covenant people.
- You plan to further define when and how the **image of God** and **moral responsibility** emerged.

> 🔖 Follow-up topic: Formally clarify what constitutes the “creation of humanity” in a theological sense, to satisfy the claim that “man was created to have relationship with God” despite evolutionary origins.

## Human Vocation

- Humans are created for **communion with God** and to **steward creation**.
- The fall fractured this relationship but did not destroy the imago Dei.
