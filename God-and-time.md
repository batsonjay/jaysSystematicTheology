# God and Time

This document explores the nature of God's relationship to time — a foundational metaphysical and theological concern — through a survey of competing models, key thinkers, implications, and an adopted position within this systematic theology.

## I. Eternalism and the Block Universe

**Definition**: Eternalism (also known as the Block Universe theory) is a philosophical model of time in which **past, present, and future all equally exist**. Time is seen as a fourth dimension akin to space, and the universe is a fixed four-dimensional block — with all events already “laid out.”

### Key Principles of Eternalism
- The flow of time is an illusion of human perception.
- Temporal becoming is not an objective feature of reality.
- All points in time are ontologically equivalent.

### Implications for Theology
- Supports the idea that God sees all of history “at once.”
- Suggests God's knowledge is not foreknowledge (in the temporal sense), but rather **atemporal** knowledge of all temporal events.
- Reinforces divine immutability and omniscience.
- Challenges the notion of libertarian free will.

### Notable Advocates
- **John Polkinghorne** (theological integration)
- **J.M.E. McTaggart** (in original formulation)
- **Augustine** (arguably eternalist in some interpretations)
- Many philosophers in the "B-theory" of time tradition

## II. Polkinghorne’s Theological Adaptation

**John Polkinghorne**, a physicist and Anglican theologian, adopted a theologically nuanced version of the Block Universe idea.

### Polkinghorne's Position:
- God exists **outside of time** ("meta-time") but **interacts dynamically with creation**, which experiences time linearly.
- Creation is embedded in a temporal unfolding process.
- God perceives the entire block but also **acts within it**, not as a frozen observer but as one engaging with a growing world.

### Key Ideas:
- God is **eternal** but not **timeless** in the Boethian sense.
- God's knowledge is not passively deterministic but relationally dynamic.
- Free will is real within creation, yet God eternally knows all outcomes.

### Theological Benefit:
- Preserves both God's sovereignty and human freedom.
- Avoids the "frozen God" critique of classical theism.
- Allows divine responsiveness while maintaining omniscience.

## III. Contrast: William Lane Craig’s View

William Lane Craig strongly rejects the Block Universe view.

### Craig’s Position:
- Defends **A-theory of time** (Presentism): only the present is real.
- Argues that God exists in **real, flowing time**.
- God's knowledge of future contingents is **foreknowledge**, not atemporal awareness.

### Key Claims:
- A temporal God is necessary for relationality and love.
- The universe began to exist, and God’s act of creation marks the beginning of time.
- Time is a dynamic unfolding, not a static block.

### Critiques of Eternalism:
- Denies genuine becoming and change.
- Makes human freedom and responsibility illusory.
- Incompatible with divine responsiveness and personal relationship.

## IV. Philosophical and Theological Comparison

| Feature                     | Eternalism / Polkinghorne        | Presentism / Craig            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Ontology of Time            | All moments equally real         | Only present is real          |
| God’s Relation to Time      | Outside time (meta-time)         | Inside flowing time           |
| Free Will                   | Affirmed (with nuance)           | Affirmed (libertarian)        |
| Omniscience                 | Atemporal knowledge of all time  | Temporal foreknowledge        |
| Immutability                | Strong (unchanging nature)       | Weaker (relational change)    |
| Divine Action               | Responsive within the block      | Responsive in real-time       |

## V. Follow-Up: Timelessness and Boethian Models

You asked how Polkinghorne's view compared to the classical **Boethian timelessness** model.

### Boethian View:
- God exists entirely **outside** of time.
- Time is a created dimension; God sees all events “in a single glance.”
- God does not experience sequence or succession.

### Polkinghorne's Adjustment:
- God is eternal **but not static**.
- Experiences **meta-temporal succession** — God is not "in" time but still acts sequentially relative to creation.
- This avoids the charge of a “frozen” God and allows responsive action.

## VI. Adapting the Kalam Cosmological Argument to Polkinghorne’s Model

### Classical Kalam (Craig’s Version):
1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
2. The universe began to exist.
3. Therefore, the universe has a cause (God).
4. That cause must be outside time and space and must transcend the universe.
5. Hence, God exists outside time and creates the universe from nothing.

### Adapted Kalam (Polkinghorne-Informed):
1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
2. The universe began to exist and unfolds as a temporally embedded block.
3. Therefore, the universe has a cause — a Creator external to time.
4. God exists in **meta-time**, observing the full block (past/present/future) and acting within it.
5. God’s causality is not limited to the temporal beginning but includes sustaining and interacting with all events.
6. Therefore, God is both transcendent (creating the block) and immanently involved (responsive within the block).

**Benefit**: Maintains the force of the Kalam argument for a transcendent Creator, while adjusting the metaphysical assumptions about time to harmonize with Eternalism and a dynamic divine nature.

## VII. Final Adopted View in This System

This theological system adopts:

- **Polkinghorne’s adaptation of the Block Universe view** as the best metaphysical model of God’s relationship to time.
- God exists in **meta-time**, perceiving and interacting with all moments.
- God is not timeless in the classical Boethian sense, but **eternal and relational**.
- This view preserves:
  - Divine omniscience (atemporal and complete knowledge)
  - Human freedom (within a temporally real creation)
  - Divine action (responsive, not frozen)
  - The usefulness of the Kalam argument (in its adapted form)

---

This view influences related doctrines including:
- **Omniscience**: God knows all events as present to him.
- **Omnipresence**: Affirmed as **punctiliar presence** — God is fully present at each point in spacetime.
- **Christology**: Shapes the understanding of incarnation as an entry into linear time by one who exists meta-temporally.
- **Predestination**: Enables **Molinism** as a model consistent with both omniscience and libertarian freedom.

## VIII. What Physics Says About the Block Universe

In relation to Eternalism and the Block Universe, current best physics and mathematics:

1. **Do not prevent the Block Universe.**  
   - Special Relativity (Minkowski spacetime) and General Relativity (4D curved spacetime) are naturally formulated as entire 4‑dimensional spacetimes.
   - The equations describe whole space–time histories; they do not contain a built‑in “moving now” or an objective edge of reality where the present advances.
   - Relativistic Quantum Field Theory also treats fields over 4D spacetime, which again fits naturally with a block‑style picture.

2. **Do not strictly entail the Block Universe either.**  
   - From the raw mathematics you get a 4D spacetime structure.
   - The further claim that “all times are equally real” is a metaphysical interpretation, not a theorem of SR/GR/QFT.
   - Presentism or a “growing block” can be overlaid on the same equations only by adding extra metaphysical structure (e.g., a privileged global present or objective becoming) that the physics itself does not specify.

3. **Underdetermine metaphysics, but favor the Block reading.**  
   - Physics underdetermines the metaphysics of time: it neither proves nor refutes Eternalism.
   - However, the Block Universe is a straightforward, simple reading of relativistic spacetime, whereas presentism/growing block require additional metaphysical assumptions that go beyond what the equations themselves state.
