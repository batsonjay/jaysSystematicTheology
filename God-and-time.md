# God and Time

This file now serves as a **pointer** into the more fully structured God–nature–and–attributes mini-locus.

The substantive content previously here has been integrated into:

- `God-nature-and-attributes/relationship-to-time.md`  
  – concise adopted position on God’s relation to time.
- `God-nature-and-attributes/notes/relationship-to-time-notes.md`  
  – detailed survey of Eternalism vs Presentism, Polkinghorne and Craig, Boethian timelessness, the adapted Kalam argument, and physics-and-time reflections.

For doctrinal work on God and time going forward, treat **`God-nature-and-attributes/relationship-to-time*.md`** as the primary locus, with this file functioning as a high-level entry point.
