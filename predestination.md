# Predestination

This document explores the various models of predestination that have shaped Christian theology, with detailed attention to their treatment of divine foreknowledge, human freedom, and salvation. It concludes (for now) with the adopted position of this system: **Comprehensive Omniscience**, an adaptation of Molinism that aims to preserve libertarian freedom within a framework of divine sovereignty.

Predestination here is closely related to the loci of [salvation](./salvation.md), the [problem of evil](./problem-of-evil.md), and [God and time](./God-and-time.md). Those documents provide additional context and are in various stages of development.

## I. Background and Biblical Foundations

**Predestination** is the doctrine concerned with how — and whether — God determines the eternal destinies of individuals, especially in relation to salvation.

Key biblical themes include:
- God’s **foreknowledge** and **purpose** (e.g., Romans 8–9; Ephesians 1)
- Human **responsibility** and the call to repent and believe (e.g., Acts 2; John 3)
- God’s desire that **all be saved** (e.g., 1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9)

These themes immediately raise questions that overlap with other loci:
- How can God foreknow the future without causing it? (see **God and time**)
- Can humans be truly free if their destinies are predetermined? (see **anthropology** and **human freedom**)
- What does it mean for God to “elect” some to salvation? (see **salvation**)
- How do divine justice and mercy interact in eternal outcomes? (see **problem of evil**)

At this stage of the project, I am not attempting a full biblical-theological treatment of every relevant passage. Instead, I am focusing on the **conceptual space** shaped by these texts and the main models the church has developed in response.

## II. Survey of Major Views

This section sketches three major models that have significantly shaped Christian reflection on predestination. There are many variations and mediating positions; the goal here is not exhaustive taxonomy but a representative survey.

### 1. Classical Calvinism

**Core Tenets**:
- **Unconditional Election**: God elects some to salvation and others to reprobation based solely on His will.
- **Irresistible Grace**: The elect cannot finally reject God’s saving call.
- **Total Depravity**: Humans are incapable of choosing God on their own.
- **(Often) Double Predestination**: God ordains both the saved and the damned.

**Strengths**:
- Emphasizes divine sovereignty and initiative.
- Takes sin and grace with great seriousness.
- Avoids synergism (the idea that humans cooperate with God to "complete" salvation).

**Objections** (as I see them):
- Appears to make God the author of evil or at least its determiner in a way that strains moral intuition.
- Challenges meaningful human responsibility if all choices are ultimately determined by God’s decree.
- Seems to sit in tension with the universal offer of the gospel and with texts stressing God’s desire that all be saved.

### 2. Arminianism

**Core Tenets** (as refined by Jacobus Arminius and the Remonstrants):
- **Conditional Election**: Based on God’s foreknowledge of who would believe.
- **Resistible Grace**: Humans can reject God’s call.
- **Prevenient Grace**: God enables all people to respond to Him, countering total depravity.
- **Libertarian Free Will**: Humans have genuine alternative possibilities in their moral choices.

**Strengths**:
- Protects human freedom and moral responsibility.
- Preserves God’s universal love and salvific will.
- Provides grounds for evangelism and moral accountability.

**Objections** (as I see them):
- Risks suggesting that God’s will is contingent on, or limited by, human action.
- Can drift toward semi-Pelagianism if God’s initiative is not clearly foregrounded.
- May seem to weaken divine sovereignty, especially if foreknowledge is construed as mere passive foresight.

### 3. Molinism (Middle Knowledge)

**Origin**: Luis de Molina (16th century Jesuit theologian).

**Core Insight**: God possesses three “moments” of knowledge:
1. **Natural Knowledge**: All logical possibilities.
2. **Middle Knowledge**: All **counterfactuals of creaturely freedom** — what any free creature *would* do in any circumstance.
3. **Free Knowledge**: What God freely chooses to actualize.

**How It Works (in brief)**:
- God knows what every free creature would do in every possible situation.
- By creating a specific world, God brings about certain outcomes **without violating human freedom**.
- Election is grounded in God’s middle knowledge — He chooses a world in which certain people freely respond to His grace.

**Strengths**:
- Offers a strong account of divine omniscience and sovereignty.
- Preserves libertarian free will.
- Provides a nuanced theodicy (explaining evil via actualized free choices).
- Avoids (at least on its own terms) both Calvinist determinism and an Arminian sense of divine contingency.

**Objections**:
- Are counterfactuals of freedom “real” before God chooses to actualize a world?
- Does middle knowledge sneak in a kind of determinism by fixing which counterfactuals are true?
- Is it coherent to say that God chooses the world, but not the outcomes, if those outcomes are known in advance?

**Typical Molinist Responses**:
- Counterfactuals have **truth-value independent of God's will**, grounded in the possible essences of agents.
- God knows them *logically prior* to His creative decision.
- Actualization is not coercion; it is the orchestration of free choices in a particular world.

## III. Comparative Summary

To summarize some of the contrasts:

| Feature               | Calvinism                      | Arminianism                        | Molinism                             |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Election              | Unconditional                  | Conditional (foreseen faith)       | Grounded in middle knowledge         |
| Human Freedom         | Compatibilist                  | Libertarian                        | Libertarian                          |
| Divine Sovereignty    | Maximal via decree             | Constrained by foreseen response   | Maximal via world choice             |
| Problem of Evil       | God's decree permits evil      | Free will permits evil             | Actualized free choices              |
| Evangelism            | For the elect (in effect)      | For all                            | For all, with genuinely free outcomes|

This table is schematic and could be refined; its purpose is to situate my adopted view within the larger landscape, not to foreclose debate.

## IV. Evaluation and Arguments (Provisional)

At an earlier stage I leaned strongly toward a broadly Arminian framework because of its emphasis on **human freedom** and **divine love**. Over time, however, I became increasingly persuaded that:

1. Divine omniscience must include more than mere passive foresight; God’s knowing the future is intimately connected to His wise ordering of history.
2. Human moral responsibility requires a robust sense of libertarian freedom, especially in matters of salvation and culpable evil.
3. Any adequate model must grapple seriously with the **problem of evil** and with God’s relation to time (see the [problem of evil](./problem-of-evil.md) and [God and time](./God-and-time.md) files).

Molinism, especially when combined with an account of God’s relation to time that includes something like **meta-time**, seemed to offer a better way of holding these strands together:

- God’s knowledge is **comprehensive** (natural, middle, and free knowledge).
- God’s sovereignty is real, not merely reactive; He chooses which world to actualize.
- Human freedom remains libertarian: agents genuinely could have done otherwise in the circumstances.

At the same time, I remain cautious:
- The metaphysics of counterfactuals of freedom is philosophically contested.
- The exact relation between God’s timeless knowledge (or meta-temporal knowledge) and temporal sequences is still under development in my thinking.
- Other mediating views (e.g., certain forms of open theism, or more modestly revised Calvinisms/Arminianisms) may yet prove more convincing as my study deepens.

So the arguments here are **provisional**, not final. They represent my current best attempt to balance Scripture, tradition, and philosophical coherence.

## V. Adopted Position: "Comprehensive Omniscience"

**Working Definition** (subject to refinement):

> God, existing in meta-time (see [God and time](./God-and-time.md)), possesses comprehensive omniscience, including natural, middle, and free knowledge. In His sovereign wisdom, He actualizes a world in which all freely chosen actions are known — not caused — by Him. This framework aims to uphold divine sovereignty, moral responsibility, and the authentic freedom of the human will.

Key features:

- **Meta-time and Omniscience**: God’s life is not confined to created time; in a Polkinghorne-style Eternalist view, God stands in a kind of meta-temporal relation to the entire temporal order, knowing all events and counterfactuals.
- **Middle Knowledge**: God knows, prior to His choice to create, what every possible creature would freely do in any possible circumstance.
- **World Choice**: On the basis of this knowledge, God freely chooses to actualize a particular world-order in which His purposes are realized through genuinely free choices.
- **Election**: Election is not deterministic in the sense of a unilateral decree that bypasses freedom, but neither is it merely reactive. It is **proactive orchestration**: God chooses a world in which some persons freely respond to His grace, and this choice is part of His eternal plan.

Connections to other loci:
- With respect to **salvation**, this view attempts to affirm both the universal offer of the gospel and the reality that not all freely accept it (see [salvation](./salvation.md)).
- With respect to the **problem of evil**, it suggests that God may have morally sufficient reasons for actualizing a world with significant evil, given the complex network of free choices involved (see [problem of evil](./problem-of-evil.md)).
- With respect to **divine nature and attributes**, it assumes a robust account of omniscience and sovereignty (see [divine nature and attributes](./divine-nature-and-attributes.md)).

---

## VI. Implications and Pastoral Considerations

Some implications of the adopted view:

- **Salvation**: God’s saving action is both **particular** (He knows who will respond and structures the world accordingly) and **universal in offer** (the call genuinely goes out to all). No one is lost apart from their own free rejection of grace.
- **Evangelism**: Proclamation and mission remain essential. Under comprehensive omniscience, evangelism is one of the means God has woven into the world-order by which people freely come to faith.
- **Prayer**: Prayer is not futile; rather, it may be among the conditions under which certain free responses occur. God can take account of our prayers in His choice of which world to actualize and in His ongoing governance of that world.
- **Theodicy**: While this view does not solve the problem of evil, it offers a framework: God creates a world with what He judges to be the best balance of goods, including significant freedom and opportunity for salvation, even though this entails real risk and tragedy.
- **Grace**: Grace remains primary. On this account, no one comes to God apart from enabling grace, yet that grace does not override or coerce human freedom.

These implications touch multiple loci and should be read alongside the relevant files for a fuller picture.

## VII. Objections and Responses (In Progress)

This section is intentionally underdeveloped and will need further work. Some key objections to the adopted view (and to Molinism more broadly) include:

1. **Metaphysical Concerns about Counterfactuals**: Are counterfactuals of creaturely freedom really grounded in anything, or are they metaphysical "free lunches"? If their truth-values are brute, does this compromise divine aseity?
2. **Hidden Determinism**: If God knows all counterfactuals and chooses which world to actualize, does this amount to a subtle form of determinism after all?
3. **Biblical Concerns**: Does this model genuinely emerge from Scripture, or is it excessively driven by philosophical speculation about possible worlds and meta-time?

**Provisional Responses** (to be expanded):
- I am tentatively open to the idea that counterfactuals of freedom are grounded in the essences of possible agents, and that God’s knowledge of them is part of His perfection.
- I distinguish between **determinism** (no genuine alternatives) and **foreknown free choice** in a world God wisely chooses; the latter seems more compatible with moral responsibility.
- Any model of predestination will employ some philosophical categories; the question is whether they serve, rather than distort, the biblical witness. This remains an open area of discernment.

This section will likely grow as I engage more deeply with critics of Molinism and alternative models.

## VIII. Open Questions and Deferred Issues

This file represents a **work in progress**. Some explicit open questions and deferred areas of study:

- **Scriptural Exegesis**: I need more detailed engagement with key passages (Romans 8–9; Ephesians 1; John 6; 1 Timothy 2; 2 Peter 3; etc.) to test whether comprehensive omniscience/Molinism is genuinely the best fit.
- **Relation to Time**: The exact nature of meta-time and God’s relation to temporal succession requires further work (see [God and time](./God-and-time.md)).
- **Interaction with Other Loci**: How this model of predestination interfaces with doctrines of sin, human nature, and sanctification (see [anthropology](./anthropology.md), [human nature](./human-nature.md)) needs more attention.
- **Alternative Models**: I want to continue exploring refined forms of Calvinism, Arminianism, Barthian election, and open theism, to see whether comprehensive omniscience remains the most persuasive overall.

For now, **Comprehensive Omniscience** is the *adopted view* in this project, held with a posture of humility and openness to revision as I continue to study Scripture, the Christian tradition, and philosophical theology.
