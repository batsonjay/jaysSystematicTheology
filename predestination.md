# Predestination

This document explores the various models of predestination that have shaped Christian theology, with detailed attention to their treatment of divine foreknowledge, human freedom, and salvation. It concludes with the adopted position of this system: **Comprehensive Omniscience**, an adaptation of Molinism that preserves libertarian freedom within a framework of divine sovereignty.

## I. The Theological Challenge

Predestination is the doctrine concerned with how — and whether — God determines the eternal destinies of individuals, especially in relation to salvation.

Key questions:
- How can God foreknow the future without causing it?
- Can humans be truly free if their destinies are predetermined?
- What does it mean for God to “elect” some to salvation?
- How do divine justice and mercy interact in eternal outcomes?

## II. Major Historical Models

### 1. **Classical Calvinism**

**Core Tenets**:
- **Unconditional Election**: God elects some to salvation and others to reprobation based solely on His will.
- **Irresistible Grace**: The elect cannot reject God’s saving call.
- **Total Depravity**: Humans are incapable of choosing God on their own.
- **Double Predestination**: God ordains both the saved and the damned.

**Strengths**:
- Emphasizes divine sovereignty and initiative.
- Takes sin and grace seriously.
- Avoids synergism (cooperative salvation).

**Objections**:
- Appears to make God the author of evil.
- Challenges meaningful human responsibility.
- Undermines the universal offer of the gospel.

### 2. **Arminianism**

**Core Tenets** (as refined by Jacobus Arminius and the Remonstrants):
- **Conditional Election**: Based on God’s foreknowledge of who would believe.
- **Resistible Grace**: Humans can reject God’s call.
- **Prevenient Grace**: God enables all people to respond to Him.
- **Libertarian Free Will**: Humans have genuine moral freedom.

**Strengths**:
- Protects human freedom and moral responsibility.
- Preserves God’s universal love and salvific will.
- Provides grounds for evangelism and moral accountability.

**Objections**:
- Suggests God’s will is contingent on human action.
- Risk of semi-Pelagianism (salvation by human initiative).
- Weakens divine sovereignty.

### 3. **Molinism (Middle Knowledge)**

**Origin**: Luis de Molina (16th century Jesuit theologian)

**Core Insight**:
- God possesses **three “moments” of knowledge**:
  1. **Natural Knowledge**: All logical possibilities.
  2. **Middle Knowledge**: All **counterfactuals of creaturely freedom** — what any free creature *would* do in any circumstance.
  3. **Free Knowledge**: What God freely chooses to actualize.

**How It Works**:
- God knows what every free creature would do in every possible situation.
- By creating a specific world, God brings about certain outcomes **without violating human freedom**.
- Election is grounded in God’s middle knowledge — He chooses a world in which certain people freely respond to His grace.

**Strengths**:
- Strong account of divine omniscience and sovereignty.
- Preserves libertarian free will.
- Offers nuanced theodicy (explaining evil via actualized free choices).
- Avoids Calvinist determinism and Arminian contingency.

**Objections**:
- Are counterfactuals of freedom “real” before God chooses to actualize a world?
- Does middle knowledge imply determinism in disguise?
- Is it coherent to say that God chooses the world, but not the outcomes?

**Responses**:
- Molinists argue counterfactuals have **truth-value independent of God's will**, grounded in the possible essence of agents.
- God knows them *logically prior* to His creative decision.
- Actualization is not coercion; it is the orchestration of free choices.

| Feature                      | Calvinism                  | Arminianism                | Molinism                         |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Election                    | Unconditional               | Conditional (foreseen faith) | Based on middle knowledge        |

## IV. Your Chosen Model: Comprehensive Omniscience

You initially leaned toward **Arminianism**, due to its strong affirmation of human freedom and divine love. However, upon deeper exploration of Molinism and God’s relation to time, you found its framework more coherent with your metaphysics — particularly your acceptance of:

- **Meta-time** (a Polkinghorne-style Eternalist view)
- **Middle knowledge**
- **Libertarian freedom**
- **A relational yet sovereign God**

### Summary of Comprehensive Omniscience:
- God exists in **meta-time** and has **middle knowledge** of all counterfactuals of free choices.
- God sovereignly chooses to actualize a world in which creatures **freely** choose their paths.
- This preserves:
  - Divine omniscience (all outcomes known)
  - Divine sovereignty (world choice)
  - Human freedom (non-coerced response)
- God’s election is not deterministic, but also not reactive — it is **proactive orchestration** based on true knowledge of what would freely occur.

---

## V. Theological Implications

- **Salvation**: God’s saving action is both **particular** (He knows who will respond) and **universal in offer**.
- **Evangelism**: Still meaningful — the preaching of the gospel is the means God uses in worlds where people freely respond.
- **Prayer**: Not futile — prayer may be part of the conditions under which people freely choose salvation.
- **Theodicy**: God created a world with the best possible balance of good, freedom, and opportunity for salvation.
- **Grace**: Still primary — God must extend grace for anyone to believe, but He does so in a way consistent with their free response.

---

## VI. Final Adopted Statement

> God, existing in meta-time, possesses comprehensive omniscience, including natural, middle, and free knowledge. In His sovereign wisdom, He actualizes a world in which all freely chosen actions are known — not caused — by Him. This framework upholds divine sovereignty, moral responsibility, and the authentic freedom of the human will. Election is thus the result of God's wise orchestration of a cosmos in which His purposes are fulfilled through genuinely free agents, and salvation is made available to all, though not all will freely accept it.
