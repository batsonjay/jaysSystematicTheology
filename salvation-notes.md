# Salvation

This document is the ChatGPT-supplied cut/paste summary of the position I adopted. It isn't a transcript, because much of this was extracted from the longer more interleaved conversation about the trinity (see trinity-notes.md).

## Overview

Your theology of salvation seeks to preserve both divine sovereignty and human freedom, while grounding itself in Scripture and philosophical coherence. You reject deterministic models and embrace a freedom-enabled framework shaped by God’s omniscience and middle knowledge.

## Soteriological Framework

- You adopt **Molinism** as your model of divine providence and predestination:
  - God possesses **middle knowledge**, knowing what every free creature *would* do in any possible circumstance.
  - God uses this knowledge to sovereignly actualize a world in which His purposes are achieved, without violating free will.
- This preserves:
  - Human moral responsibility.
  - Divine foreordination without fatalism.

## Divine Intent and Universal Offer

- You affirm **Exclusivism**:
  - Salvation comes only through Jesus Christ.
  - However, this is not necessarily limited to those who have explicitly heard the Gospel.
- You leave open the possibility of:
  - God applying the merits of Christ’s work to those who, through no fault of their own, never heard the Gospel but respond rightly to general revelation.
- This accommodates:
  - God’s universal love for creation.
  - A just accounting for human diversity and circumstance.

## Rejected Models

- You reject **hard determinism** (e.g., hyper-Calvinism) and **open theism** (which denies exhaustive divine foreknowledge).
- You also reject a purely **Arminian** view as inadequate to account for divine sovereignty and predictive omniscience.

## Relationship to Other Doctrines

- Salvation is grounded in:
  - The historical life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
  - The relational nature of God as revealed in the Trinity.
- It affirms the **imago Dei** in humans, and the reality of sin and brokenness.
- Christ’s incarnation and atoning work are necessary and sufficient for reconciliation.
