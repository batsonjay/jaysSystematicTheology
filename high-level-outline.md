You have chosen to begin your systematic theology with rational foundations for theism, forming a coherent basis before moving to divine revelation.

## Adopted Argument: The Kalam Cosmological Argument

You find the **Kalam Cosmological Argument** compelling, especially as developed by **William Lane Craig**:

### Basic Form:
1. **Whatever begins to exist has a cause.**
2. **The universe began to exist.**
3. **Therefore, the universe has a cause.**

### Supporting Reasoning:
- **Philosophical defense of the impossibility of actual infinities** (e.g., Hilbert’s Hotel).
- **Scientific support from cosmology**, especially the Big Bang model, showing the universe had a beginning.
- The cause must be:
  - **Uncaused**, **changeless**, **immaterial**, **timeless** (sans creation),
  - **Spaceless**, and **enormously powerful**—consistent with God.

### Theological Additions:
- Craig argues that **God existed timelessly before creation**, but enters time **at** creation.
- You differ slightly: adopting **Polkinghorne’s block universe model**, you hold that God exists in **meta-time**, eternally seeing all of history as a whole, rather than entering into time at a specific moment.

## Future Exploration Topics:
You have deferred full incorporation of other arguments for God’s existence until later, including:
- The **Fine-Tuning Argument** (not yet evaluated)
- The **Moral Argument**
- The **Contingency Argument**
- The **Ontological Argument**
