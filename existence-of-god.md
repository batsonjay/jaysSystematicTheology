# Arguments for the Existence of God

## Adopted View

You have adopted the **Kalam Cosmological Argument**, especially as developed by William Lane Craig. Its key claims:

1. **Whatever begins to exist has a cause.**  
2. **The universe began to exist.**  
3. **Therefore, the universe has a cause.**

Craig further argues:
- The cause must be **spaceless, timeless, immaterial, personal, and immensely powerful**.
- A **personal** cause is inferred due to the ability to choose to create (rather than impersonal necessity).
- He refutes infinite regress via arguments from both **philosophy** and **modern cosmology** (e.g., Big Bang theory, thermodynamics).

You find this argument persuasive and have added it to your system.

## Notes for Future Exploration

- You intend to evaluate **fine-tuning arguments** for God's existence in a separate thread (referenced in your chat log).
- You also plan to engage more deeply with **natural theology** and possibly **ontological** and **moral arguments** later.
