# Arguments for the Existence of God

## Adopted View: Kalam Cosmological Argument (William Lane Craig)

You have adopted the Kalam Cosmological Argument, especially as developed by William Lane Craig. Its classic syllogism:

1. Premise 1: Whatever begins to exist has a cause.  
2. Premise 2: The universe began to exist.  
3. Conclusion: Therefore, the universe has a cause.

Craig further argues:
- The cause must be spaceless, timeless (sans creation), immaterial, personal, and immensely powerful.
- The personal aspect is inferred because only a personal agent can initiate a temporal effect from a timeless cause; this reflects an ability to choose to create, rather than acting from impersonal necessity.
- An actual infinite regress of past events is impossible; both philosophical arguments and modern cosmology (e.g., Big Bang theory, thermodynamics/entropy) support a beginning of the universe.

Reasons you find this persuasive:
- Philosophical coherence of the causal principles and the argument’s structure.
- Support from modern cosmology (e.g., Big Bang theory).
- Alignment with monotheism over deism or pantheism.

This argument is adopted into your system.

## Integration with Other Beliefs

You reconcile this with your Block Universe view by positing that:
- God existed in meta-time before creation.
- Creation involved God’s transition into cosmic time, thereby entering a relational timeline with creation.

## Future Topics to Explore

You plan to examine further arguments for the existence of God and how they interact with your theology:
- Fine-Tuning Argument — recently bookmarked for later discussion.
- Ontological Argument — explore Anselm’s and Plantinga’s formulations.
- Moral Argument — especially in relation to divine nature and objective morality.
- Contingency Argument — especially Leibnizian versions.
- Broader Natural Theology — deeper engagement across classical and contemporary lines.
