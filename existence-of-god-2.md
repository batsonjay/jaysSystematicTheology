# The Existence of God

## Adopted Argument: Kalam Cosmological Argument (William Lane Craig)

You have adopted the **Kalam Cosmological Argument**, primarily as developed by William Lane Craig:

1. **Premise 1**: Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
2. **Premise 2**: The universe began to exist.
3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the universe has a cause.

Craig adds that:
- The cause must be **spaceless, timeless (sans creation), immaterial, powerful, and personal**.
- The personal aspect is argued from the notion that only a personal agent could initiate a temporal effect from a timeless cause.

You appreciate:
- The **philosophical coherence** of the argument.
- Its support from **modern cosmology** (e.g., Big Bang theory).
- Its alignment with **monotheism** over deism or pantheism.

## Integration with Other Beliefs

- You reconcile this with your **Block Universe** view by positing that:
  - God existed in **meta-time** before creation.
  - Creation involved God’s transition into **cosmic time**, thus entering a relational timeline with creation.

## Future Topics to Explore

You plan to examine further arguments for the existence of God and how they interact with your theology:

- **Fine-Tuning Argument** — Recently bookmarked for later discussion.
- **Ontological Argument** — To explore Anselm’s and Plantinga’s formulations.
- **Moral Argument** — Especially in relation to divine nature and objective morality.
- **Contingency Argument** — Especially Leibnizian versions.
