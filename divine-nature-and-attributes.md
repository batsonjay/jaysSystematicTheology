# Divine Nature and Attributes

## Nature of God

You affirm the classical view of God as:
- **Necessary**
- **Uncaused**
- **Immaterial**
- **Personal**
- **Self-existent**
- **Maximally great** in power, knowledge, goodness, and being.

You accept **divine simplicity** in a qualified form: God is not composed of parts but has distinguishable relational attributes.

## Divine Omniscience

- **Adopted View**: **Middle Knowledge (Molinism)**  
  God knows all logically possible truths, including **counterfactuals of creaturely freedom**.  
  This allows God to sovereignly orchestrate creation while allowing libertarian freedom.  
  You replaced your earlier Arminian view with this.

---

## Divine Omnipresence

- **Adopted View**: **Punctiliar Presence**  
  God is **fully present at every point** in space and time—not just “spread out” or metaphorically “present.”  
  This preserves both **relational immediacy** and **transcendence**.

---

## Divine Omnipotence

You adopt:
1. The **contemporary compatibilist adjustment**: God can do all that is logically possible and consistent with His nature.
2. **Compatibilism**: Divine sovereignty is compatible with creaturely (libertarian) freedom, via middle knowledge.
3. **Interventionism**: God does intervene miraculously in history.
4. **Intellectualism over Voluntarism**: God’s will follows His rational nature and moral goodness.

## Divine Omnibenevolence

- **Adopted View**: **Objective morality with room for divine mystery**  
  You reject both pure voluntarism (good is whatever God wills) and pure moral realism (God is constrained by external moral laws).
  Instead, you hold that **God’s nature is the source of moral good**, and humans may not fully comprehend divine goodness, especially when resolving apparent moral tensions.

## God's Love for Creation

- You affirm a **universal, unchanging love** for all creation, with **volitional will** (not emotional variability).
- Love is **freely willed**, not emotionally reactive.
- You do not believe God's love for creation is contingent on creation’s worthiness.

## God's Relationship to Time

- **Adopted View**: **Polkinghorne’s Block Universe / Meta-Time View**  
  - God exists in **meta-time** and created the **space-time block**.
  - He sees all moments of time simultaneously (atemporally), but can act **within** time.
  - This reconciles divine foreknowledge, middle knowledge, and human freedom.
