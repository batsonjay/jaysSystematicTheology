# Divine Nature and Attributes

## Nature of God

You affirm the classical view of God as:
- Necessary
- Uncaused
- Immaterial
- Personal
- Self-existent (aseity)
- Maximally great in power, knowledge, goodness, and being

You accept divine simplicity in a qualified form: God is not composed of parts, but His perfections can be distinguished in concept and in relational expression.

## God’s Relationship to Time

- Adopted View: Polkinghorne’s Block Universe (Eternalism) with Meta-Time
  - All moments of time—past, present, future—are equally real in the created space-time “block.”
  - God is not strictly “timeless” nor fully “within time,” but exists in meta-time, viewing the whole temporal order while able to act within it.
  - God’s omniscience includes the whole of time “at once,” while divine action is genuinely relational in the created temporal sequence.
  - This model coheres with Middle Knowledge and preserves both divine sovereignty and creaturely freedom.

Further study you plan:
- A-theory vs B-theory of time
- Boethian timelessness
- Formal analysis of Block Universe and meta-time

## Divine Omniscience

- Adopted View: Middle Knowledge (Molinism)
  - God knows all logically possible truths, including counterfactuals of creaturely freedom.
  - This permits God to sovereignly actualize a world in which free creatures act, without causal determination.
  - Comprehensive omniscience: God knows all things actual and possible, consistently with His relational engagement in time (from meta-time).
  - You replaced your earlier Arminian view with this.
    - Prior Arminian view (simple foreknowledge): God infallibly foreknows future free choices without determining them; providence is responsive rather than strongly actualizing via counterfactuals (no middle-knowledge grounding).

## Divine Omnipresence

- Adopted View: Punctiliar Presence
  - God is fully present at every point in space-time—neither merely “spread out” nor only metaphorically present.
  - His presence is actual, personal, and relationally immediate in each location, though not always manifest.
  - This view arose in modern theology and emphasizes relational immediacy over abstract substance metaphysics.
  - Objections regarding localization or spatial limitation are addressed within the meta-time framework.

---

## Divine Omnipotence

- Contemporary compatibilist adjustment:
  - God can do all that is logically possible and consistent with His nature.
  - Voluntary self-limitation for the sake of creaturely freedom and meaningful relationship.
- You also affirm:
  - Interventionist capacity: God can act miraculously within creation.
  - Intellectualism over voluntarism: God’s will follows His wisdom and moral goodness, not arbitrary decree.

---

## Divine Omnibenevolence

- Adopted View: God’s nature is the standard of moral goodness.
  - You reject pure voluntarism (good is whatever God wills) and strict external moral realism (God constrained by an external moral order).
  - Goodness is objectively real and is expressed perfectly in divine action.
  - Goodness entails moral coherence, relational faithfulness, and truthfulness, ultimately grounded in God’s unchanging character.
  - Room remains for divine mystery when resolving apparent tensions in human moral perception.

---

## God’s Love for Creation

- Universal and unchanging love, expressed volitionally (not as emotional variability).
- Love is freely willed and personally relational in time, consistent with meta-time.
- God's love is personal, dynamic, and responsive within the framework of meta-time.
- Love can be particular and covenantal (He relates to specific peoples/persons) while remaining universally benevolent.
- God’s love is not contingent on creation’s worthiness.

Note: You currently lean Exclusivist regarding salvation through Christ alone, pending fuller exploration of salvation and human freedom.

## Current Open Topics

You intend further work on:
- Divine simplicity (formal analysis), immutability, and impassibility
- Aseity (assumed, not yet explored in depth)
- Time: A-theory vs B-theory; Boethian timelessness; Block Universe formalization
- Substance language of the Trinity (to be addressed in Trinitarian doctrine)
