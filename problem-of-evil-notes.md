# Problem of Evil – Notes

_This file collects exploratory material, earlier drafts, and open questions related to the doctrine-level summary in `problem-of-evil.md`. It is intentionally more informal and may contain tentative or redundant content. The normalized locus-level statement lives in `problem-of-evil.md`._

## 1. High-Level Orientation

- This project treats the **problem of evil** as a central testing ground for how doctrines of God, creation, providence, human freedom, sin, and salvation fit together.
- Current working posture:
  - Affirm **moral realism**: good and evil are objectively grounded in God’s character.
  - Affirm **libertarian human freedom** as important for love and moral responsibility.
  - Affirm that God **permits but does not author evil**, and that his response to evil is climactically revealed in Christ’s cross and resurrection.
- Long-term trajectory (provisional): some kind of **Molinist-friendly free-will theodicy** integrated with soul-making, spiritual warfare, and eschatological hope.

For the public-facing, normalized summary, see `problem-of-evil.md`.

## 2. Questions and To-Do Threads

These are issues that either emerged from earlier drafts or remain explicitly deferred:

1. **Evolutionary creation and moral responsibility**  
   - How does an evolutionary account of human origins interact with the rise of genuinely responsible moral agents?  
   - What does this mean for doctrines of the fall and original sin?  

2. **Metaphysical grounding of libertarian freedom under Molinism**  
   - How exactly do libertarian choice and God’s middle knowledge fit together without collapsing into determinism or open theism?  
   - What are the best contemporary defenses of this combination? (Plantinga, Flint, Craig, et al.).

3. **Natural evil and fine-tuning**  
   - How should we understand things like disease, earthquakes, and large-scale natural disasters in a fine-tuned universe?  
   - Are some natural evils tightly tied to the same regularities that make life possible, and if so, how does that shape theodicy?  

4. **Pastoral dimensions of evil**  
   - How to talk about evil and suffering in ways that are **truthful** but not **cruel**.  
   - How lament, protest, and silence should function in pastoral responses compared with explanatory theodicies.  

5. **Integration with other loci (for later passes)**  
   - With **predestination and salvation**: reconciling election, grace, and human freedom in a world saturated with evil.  
   - With **God and time / divine attributes**: how eternity, immutability, omniscience, and omnipotence bear on God’s relation to temporal evils.  
   - With **anthropology**: how the image of God, fallenness, and human sociality inform both the capacity for evil and the hope for redemption.

Many of these questions are echoed in section VIII of `problem-of-evil.md` but are listed here to track them as live research threads.

# The Problem of Evil and Human Choice

## Overview

The Problem of Evil poses one of the most enduring and difficult challenges to theistic belief, especially belief in an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good God. This section sets the stage for theological engagement with human nature, sin, and salvation.

## Categories of Evil

- **Moral Evil**: Evil resulting from the choices of moral agents (e.g., murder, betrayal).
- **Natural Evil**: Suffering caused by impersonal natural forces (e.g., earthquakes, disease).
- **Existential Evil**: Deep, personal experiences of alienation, suffering, or despair.

## Classic Formulations

- **Logical Problem of Evil**:  
  Can an all-powerful, all-good God coexist with evil?  
  Famously articulated by Epicurus and restated in modern times by J.L. Mackie.

- **Evidential Problem of Evil**:  
  Does the extent or severity of evil make God's existence unlikely?  
  Defended by William Rowe and others.

- **Pastoral/Experiential Problem of Evil**:  
  Concerned with emotional and spiritual responses to suffering more than rational arguments.

## Major Theodicies

| Theodicy Name           | Core Idea                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Free Will Defense       | Evil is the price of granting humans free will (Alvin Plantinga).        |
| Soul-Making Theodicy    | Suffering refines virtue and character (John Hick).                      |
| Greater Good Theodicy   | God permits evil for a higher purpose, often inscrutable to humans.      |
| Warfare Theodicy        | Spiritual warfare between good and evil agents explains suffering.       |
| Redemptive Suffering    | Christ's suffering reveals God's solidarity with human pain.             |

## Your Systematic Theology

You’ve expressed that full treatment of evil will come after other foundations are laid. For now:

- ❗ *Placeholder entry*: You plan to address theodicy in depth when developing your views on salvation and human anthropology.
- You are currently working from a **Molinist** framework, which anticipates incorporating a **Free Will Defense** grounded in God’s middle knowledge.
- You have affirmed the **existence of genuine human choice** as compatible with divine foreknowledge.

## Future Work

You’ve requested a future deep dive into:

- The compatibility of evolutionary creationism with moral responsibility
- The metaphysical grounding of free will under Molinism
- The role of natural evil in a fine-tuned universe

# Evil and Human Freedom

## Theological Framework

You affirm a **libertarian view of human freedom**:
- Humans are genuinely free to choose between alternatives.
- Free will is essential for moral responsibility and love.
- This freedom is not overridden by divine causation, even though God sovereignly permits and responds to human choices.

You also affirm **moral realism**:
- There is such a thing as good and evil, objectively grounded in the nature of God.
- Evil is not created by God but permitted as a consequence of creaturely freedom.

## The Problem of Evil

You currently **defer** final conclusions on theodicy, but anticipate addressing:
- The classic problem: If God is all-good, all-knowing, and all-powerful, why does evil exist?
- The emotional/pastoral weight of suffering and injustice.
- The potential role of **soul-making**, **free will**, or **eschatological resolution** as partial answers.

You reject:
- Hard determinism (which collapses moral responsibility).
- Open theism (which diminishes divine omniscience).
- Divine culpability for evil (God permits, but does not author evil).

## Relationship to Salvation

- Evil provides the backdrop against which salvation becomes necessary and meaningful.
- You accept that God's **redemptive plan** operates within a world where evil exists, and ultimately overcomes it through Christ.
- Human choice to respond to grace is meaningful and uncoerced, enabled by God’s providential orchestration (via Molinism).

## Areas for Further Exploration

- 🔖 Revisit the **problem of natural evil** (e.g. disease, disasters) apart from moral agency.
- 🔖 Clarify your preferred theodicy (free will, soul-making, narrative, etc.).
- 🔖 Consider how evolutionary creationism influences the origin of moral agency.

## 5. Future Directions for This Notes File

Over time, this file can accumulate:

- More detailed **surveys of particular authors and arguments** (e.g., Plantinga on transworld depravity, Hick on soul-making, Rowe on evidential evil).
- Worked examples or case studies of particular evils and how different theodicies handle them.
- Draft arguments and counterarguments that may later be distilled into more polished form in `problem-of-evil.md`.
- Reading lists, quotations, and rough outlines for future passes on this locus.
