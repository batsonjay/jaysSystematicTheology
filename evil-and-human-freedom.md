# Evil and Human Freedom

## Theological Framework

You affirm a **libertarian view of human freedom**:
- Humans are genuinely free to choose between alternatives.
- Free will is essential for moral responsibility and love.
- This freedom is not overridden by divine causation, even though God sovereignly permits and responds to human choices.

You also affirm **moral realism**:
- There is such a thing as good and evil, objectively grounded in the nature of God.
- Evil is not created by God but permitted as a consequence of creaturely freedom.

## The Problem of Evil

You currently **defer** final conclusions on theodicy, but anticipate addressing:
- The classic problem: If God is all-good, all-knowing, and all-powerful, why does evil exist?
- The emotional/pastoral weight of suffering and injustice.
- The potential role of **soul-making**, **free will**, or **eschatological resolution** as partial answers.

You reject:
- Hard determinism (which collapses moral responsibility).
- Open theism (which diminishes divine omniscience).
- Divine culpability for evil (God permits, but does not author evil).

## Relationship to Salvation

- Evil provides the backdrop against which salvation becomes necessary and meaningful.
- You accept that God's **redemptive plan** operates within a world where evil exists, and ultimately overcomes it through Christ.
- Human choice to respond to grace is meaningful and uncoerced, enabled by God’s providential orchestration (via Molinism).

## Areas for Further Exploration

- 🔖 Revisit the **problem of natural evil** (e.g. disease, disasters) apart from moral agency.
- 🔖 Clarify your preferred theodicy (free will, soul-making, narrative, etc.).
- 🔖 Consider how evolutionary creationism influences the origin of moral agency.
