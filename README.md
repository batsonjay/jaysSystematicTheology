# Jay’s Systematic Theology

This repository is a **writing and research project**, not a software application. It is an evolving, markdown-based attempt to build a personal systematic theology.

Atypically for a Cline-related project, there is **no code** here: the value is entirely in the ideas and how they are organized.

## Product Context

The context for this project is driven by its purpose more than by any technical requirements.

### Motivating Questions

Humans are inclined to ask questions:
- Where did world come from?
- What is the purpose of human existence?
- Is there anything “more” than this?
- Is there a meaning of life, and if so, what is it?
- Should I believe that (a) God exists? If so, what does that mean - for the world, or for me?
- How should one live?

This is similar to philosophy, but answered via a reasoned basis of the existence of God made known via Israel & revealed in Christ Jesus. Theology can be called “highest philosophy” - the way to lead life - so we should be intentional about developing it.

### Three key purposes

1. **Personal Learning and Discernment**  
   To create a well-structured, comprehensive place to track ongoing theological study. As new insights and perspectives are discovered, this system may evolve, reflecting a personal journey of exploration and understanding.

2. **Defense of the Faith**  
   To provide a coherent and compelling articulation of Christian belief. The goal is to demonstrate to skeptical or non-Christian friends that this theology is not based on fairy tales, but on reasoned, informed thought. It should invite sincere seekers to engage more deeply with the Christian way.

3. **Support for Struggling Believers**  
   To offer a theological framework that can aid Christians experiencing doubt or difficulty. This system seeks to affirm the intellectual and spiritual integrity of the faith, helping others reconstruct a confident and resilient belief in Christ.

## Method

The methodology of this theology project is deliberately transparent and open-ended:

- Each doctrinal topic is approached by **surveying multiple views** – historical, philosophical, and doctrinal.
- When a particular view is found persuasive, it is **explicitly adopted** and added to the developing system.
- Some views are **deferred for future study** and clearly marked as such.
- The project assumes a posture of **humility and willingness to revise**; it is a work in progress meant to mature alongside the theologian.
- The aim is not novelty for its own sake, but **deep engagement with Christian tradition** combined with personal ownership of conclusions.

## Scope and Structure

The repository is organized around standard loci of Christian systematic theology. A high-level outline is maintained in:

- [`high-level-outline.md`](high-level-outline.md)

Individual markdown files (e.g., `existence-of-god.md`, `salvation.md`, `predestination.md`, `God-and-time.md`, etc.) represent particular loci or closely related clusters.

Over time, most doctrine files are intended to share a common spine:

- Background / biblical foundations
- Survey of major views
- Evaluation and arguments
- Adopted position(s)
- Objections and responses
- Open questions / deferred issues

## How to Read and Use This Repo

- Treat each doctrine file as a **work in progress**, not a finished treatise.
- Expect explicit labels or headings where possible (e.g., “Adopted view”, “Open questions”, “Deferred issues”).
- Read with the three core purposes in mind: learning, defense of the faith, and support for believers in doubt.

For Cline-specific, tooling-oriented context (not generally needed for human readers), see the memory bank under:

- [`.clinerules/memory-bank/`](.clinerules/memory-bank/)

Those files exist to help Cline remember project intent, patterns, and progress across sessions, while this `README` remains the primary human-facing overview.
